Rittcr‘s Commentcry, and Ι have got good matter from it. Ritter

sasharp critic and a learned man, who has done something for
the explanation of Horace, and I acknowledge my obligations to
him It is his business tc excuse himself, if he can, for writing
some absurd notes and proposing some interpretatione which no
senmhle man will accept.

Ι have also used for the Satires and Epistles Kriiger’s school
edition, with Gomon notes. Itis a very usefirl book. 'l'he notes
prove thet the editor has good judgment, and what we in this
country call sound common sense, in which many learned editors
ure very deficient. ' y

1 have not touched Mr. Macleane’s arguments and introducticns,
except in very few cases3 nor have 1 added any thing on the chro-
nolcgy of the poems, except a little here and there. Mr. Maclecne
has donc this very well. He judicicusly abstained from ,fixing
dates where there is no evidence, unlilse many critice who have
sometimes fired them without evidence and sometimes contrary to
evidence Indeed, most commentatore have very imperfect concep·
tiens cf the nature of prcof; and it would be a great improvement
if they could be taught in some wey not to confound hypotheses
and guesses with probable conclusione and demonstration. ,

1 shall here put a question which some people may think unne-
ΜΨ but Ι dc not think so. When a manhasbeen used to
resd a book at intervals for helfa century, he may reasonably ask
himself whether he has been wasting his time, and whether other
persons may not do the same. There are only few books worth
roeding often cr much 3 but Horace is one of them. He lived with
some of the chief men of an age when the Roman polity was chung-
ing into a form which has had a lusting influente on Europe, and
through Europe cn the rest of the world; and his writings have
mede us familiar with the men himself, with the times in which he
lived, the character of his contemporaries, and the manners cf the
day. Horace's good sense makes his Satires and Epistles almost as ,
intelligible and as instructive as if they were written now ; for the
best pert cf them is independent cf the allusione tc things and per·

sons, and many of the allusione are not more obscure than similer

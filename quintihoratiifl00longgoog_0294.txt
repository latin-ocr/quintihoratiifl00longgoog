Scholisst Porphyrion says, “ Quidam sepnrsnt hsnc oden s superiore, sedpotest illi jungi
quonism hic 111111 dicuutur Augusti? 'l'hls isa poor resson, und there can be little
doubt the odes were written seperetely though probably sbout the sometime, on the

theu it is highly improbable that the publication 1111 delsyed 111 four years, and there
isuothing iu this ode which might not 11111 heeu written on his return‚hut much
reason to suppose it 1111. All 11111 ie here said 11 the meectioo 11 tire world ond the

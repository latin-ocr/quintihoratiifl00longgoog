OARMEN XVIII.

Thera is preserved in Athenaeus, x. p. 480, a single line of Alcaeus, of which the llmt
verse of this ode is almosta literal translation. The metra also is the orme. The verse
isos follows (44 Bergklr pandis ἄλλο φυτεύσῃς πρότερον δένδρεον duriam ‘lhe rest of
the ode is, in all probability, sclose adaptation of the poem of Alcaeus. If wawere not
put upon the right soant, as 1 think we arc, by the above hagmcnt. we should suppose
Horace hade friend Varus, whohad a ville at Tibur, sud who was making a plantation
there. Varus was the cognomen of his and Virgil's friend Quintilius, whose death is
lamenwd in 0. xxiv. of this book. But whether or no heis the person hera referred
ιο, or (which appears to Buttmann, and 1 agree with him, the better way of putting it)
whose name is used for the purpose of giving spirit ιο the ode, it is quite impossible to
say. “Sterilem agrum frustra rimeris,” as Vrsnlre judicioruly says on another equally
impossible question. It has been doubted whether Horace wrote ‘Vara' or ‘rere’ in
consequence of a nota which appears in the two Schohasts, Acron and Comm. cruc..
“suadet nt cum vernum competens tempus est nnllam arborem prim quam vitem ponat?
fram which it has been infer-red that they had ‘vere’ in their copies. Some confirma·
tion of this theory is derived from Vim. Georg. ii. elo sq. r- ⁴

'‘ Optima vinetis satio cum vere rubenti
Candida venit avis longis inrisa colubris.”

dilexisting MSS. and editions have ‘Varo’ Jahn affirms thet the person is ‘haud
dabie: the same as Canidia's old lover, spon. v.. aud Weichert (de Ia Varii et Cassii
Parmensis vita) says the same. Such boldnesa appears to me most irrational. The
respectable uernae of these scholare have misled the writer of the article Varus (xii.) in
Smith’e Dict. Biog„ who might have corrected his judgment by referring to Patre, to
whose work he refers others.

Torrentius believes the person to be that unfortunate Varus whose legions were cut
off by Aminios inGermsny,s.1>. lo. But as he supposes Catullus ιο have addreased
tha same person (0. n), who was his junior by at least halfe century, his judgment is
worth nothing. Other conjectures have been husarded by scholare of repnte, which
Ertre hes stated aud dispoeed of vary clearly.

“Of Quintilius’ Villa ruins yet remeia at Tivoli in the quartat called asterhim Quin·
tigliolo,'' says Ilea, a medalem but industriosa commentator.

ARGUMENT.

The vine is the first trae thou shouldst plant, Varus, by the walls of Tibur. Hardshipa
are only for tha sober, wine drives away ull cerea Who croalrs of battles and poverty
rather than of Bacchus and Venus, when he is melleo? But thet no man exceed,

let him think of the bloody froya os the Centaure, and Lapithae. and of thc Thracicos,

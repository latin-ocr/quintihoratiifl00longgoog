860 HORA'PII FLACCI

SATIRE ⁴IV.

Here agsiu Horace ia st paine to defend himself honr tha charge ai malevolcnoe.
rma this charge was loudly brought against him is clears sud the second Satira oi
this bools maphora gone a long way towards making him enemies. Bothe muathave
written many moro pieces thau that, ior he speaks oi ‘mes scripta' (r. 28), ‘meos
libellos ’ (v. 71). Itis probahle his other Satires were iu the same straiu aa the second,
which appears to hare been puhlished aa a specimen of the style be hera defende, bnt
which ha thought ut to abendon, for there ara uo other Satires oi that lsind. Inde·
pendent oi the above, Horace here shows something oi an author’s soreucsa in respect
to the neglect his poema had ruet with, compared with othere which he believed to hore
. lesa merit 3 and though he attributes it entirely to tho jcolousy and iears oi the multi·
tude, every man apprehendiug that he may be attached next, it is clear that be puts it
down iu some measure ta a false teste which preferred awordg flowing style te the
terrenam and eccuracp¹ of his own. The poema cf Lucilius were popular in spito nithe
looeeuoaa oi their composition and many deiecta, which s depraved toste had come to
regard as merite. (See note our. 6.) ’Πιο viruleuoe oi Lucilius’s Satires did not offect
Horace’s generalior, who could adord to adnuite them, but had uo lilring for verses that
came home to themselves. Horace began his career as a satirical writer with Lucilius
ior hie model, end the second Satira is a specimen citha style resulting stam that

imitation. Itsatuueasily upon him. Lucilius haloand, with allhia power audhis .

merite, was not the model ior him, and he was probably tannted with coming short ot*
thevigonr oi his original, and this perhaps by the persons who were loudeet in charging
him with a malignant semper. He had therefore to eet h1mseli right in respectio
Lucilius, and this he does both here and elsewhere (S. leandri. 1) with much good
temper, caudour, and forbearance He hus also to coutrast his own pratensioue with
those nithe Oriapini and Fannii oi the dog, as well as to quiet the apprehensione
oi his irienda, and disarm the malignity oi his enemies, aad thcao are the objecta
of the Satira. livery body must admire the wayiu which he tales occasion, from tho
necessity oi seii-deiencc, to pay a tribute oi grateful affection to his iether's memory,
and it would be difficolt to dud a more pleasing picture oi pateranl solicitude and anund
sense, ae applied to a hog’s edumtim, than Horace hae drawn iu the latter part of this

About the data. Fronte aays it must hove hoen written before awo. 716, when
Asinius Pollio flret introduced tha practica of regular recitatione of their worhe bg
authore. He says Horace would not have treated the recitera eo contemptuously il
their practice had come into faehicu through the example oi his friend Pollio. As 1
have said ou a. 73, 1 do not think the practice alluded to by Horace hue any thing to
do with Pollio'a practice ς and as to Faunine' books aud bnst haring been deposited, aa
acme have said, iu the library built by this same Pollio in mue. 715, there ie not the
remotest reason to believe it. Franlce says Horace could uot atthis timo hare been au
good terma with Augustus, or he would unt have mentioned ‘⁴ acerba irriaioue'’ Petillios
Capitolinus (94 sqq.)‚ who wae a friend oi his. But the only bitterness in Horuca’a
words is in the aneer which he puts into the mouth of Petillins’ friend aad condemna.
In short, the Satire appears to me to coutuin uo clue to the date; but it certainly eou-
oerus Horaea’s curly reputatiou, and eo uruat bc placed early, aud not very long aster
8. 2, which he quotea iu w. 92.

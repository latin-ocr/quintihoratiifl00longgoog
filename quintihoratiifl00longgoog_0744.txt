ARS ΡΟΕΤΙΟΑ.

Et pugilem victorem et equum certamine primum
lit juvenum curas et libera vina referre.
Discriptas servare vices operumque colores

Cur ego si nequeo ignoroque polita salutor?

Cur nescire pudens prave quam discere maloi
Versibus exponi tragicis res comica non vulta
Indignatur item privatis ac prope socco

Dignis carminibus narrari coena Thyestae.
Singula quaeque locum teneant sortita decenter.

Interdum tamen et vocem comoedia tollit,

Iratusque Chremes tumido delitigat ore3

Et tragicus plerumque dolet sermone pedestri 9³
Telephus et Peleus, cum pauper et exsul uterque

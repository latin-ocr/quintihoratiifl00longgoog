EPODON LIBER, 17. ele

OARMEN XVII.

Frnnhe considers this to be the letest ol the Epodes, written with the ironicsl pnr-
poseol making pesce between the poet sud Cunidis, whom he hed so uumerclfully
Isrnpoeued, before the publication os the peems lu which she figures. Certainly the
mcsntution is not less severe then the dietribes. I do not think it necessary or leeslble
to esslgn it u dete, end em not disposed to ngree with those who from v. 2³, “Tuis
capillus albus est odoribus,'’ infer thet this Epode wus not written, end therefore the
bools wne not published, till Horsoe wus edvenced in years, or till alter the composition
ore.iii.14(s.u.e.7290r7³0)‚ beesuse there he ssys his heir is beginning to turn
grey. If bis heir wns perlectly blscls, lt would only enhnnce the setire ef the above
assertion. The whole subjectos this querrel (es might be expected) is so obscure thet
it is useless to offer nny conjectures upon it; bnt no oue, I think, cen reed this Epode
snd suppose thet the effeir wes altogether fietltlous. Thero is too much vigour end
gemel humour in these verses to edmit ol such s notion. Admitting therefore the
existence in some shepe ol Oenidis, 1 only depr-seete the inferences derived from s too

liternl interpretation of porticuler expressions, ss noticed in the former odes referring to .

this seme women (ep. iii. 8n.; v. Introd. de).

CARMINUM ΙΙΙ. 13. 115

Τ1ιι odeis sn addicis to sfonntain, a common subject enough, end we need only
suppose that the name was suggested to Horace by the recollectione of his childhood,
without imagining him really on the point of offering sacrifico, or being iii the neigh-
bourhood of his birth-placo when he wrote. It lias something of the nature of an epi·
gramma or inscription, audis among the choicest of ilorace’s small piecee.

ARGUMENT.

Fair fountain oi Bandusis, thou ert worthy of my libatioii and of the kid that shall fall
sor thes to-morrow and dyethy eold stream with his blood. 'l'heethe summersheat
piereeth not; coelis thy water to tlie hoelis and herde. Thou too shaltbeplaoed
among the fountains of fuine when Ι sing of the oali thathangs from the rocli whence
thy bebbliug waters spring.

Orous Bandusiae, splendidior vitro,
Dulei digne mero non sine floribus
Cras donaberis haedo
Cui frons turgida cornibus
Primis et venerem et proelia destinat 3 6
Fmstra: nam gelidos inficiet tihi
Rubro sanguine riuos

Lascivi suboles gregis.
Te flagrantis atrox hora Caniculae
Nescit tangere, tu fiigus amabile ιο
Fessis vomere tauris
Praehes et pecori vago.
Fies nobilium tu quoque fontium,
Me dicente cavis impositam ilicem
Saxis, unde loquaces
Lymphae desiliunt time.

aas poet Stesichorus, as the story goes lost his eyesight ss a punishment for a poem
in which he appears ιο have ‘repeated thc ordinary storiea against Helen, and did not
recorer it till he had written another poem recauting his opprobrium verses. Of this
moabie, which is referred to in Epod. xvii. 42, aud which was very familiar to the
ancieuts, Plato has preserved the opening verses in the Phaedrus, p. 243, Δ. lt begins
thus:- «
οὐκ lcr’ ἔτομοι λόγος ebros-
ott· {flas lv moab ὠσέλμοιι,
etr lavo Πέργαμο Tpolas. (29 Bergk.)

This poem heda plain purpose with which the ode before na hes nothing iu common.
N overtheless it hes been generally supposed till of late years ιο be an imitation of Stesi-
chorus, aud some of the grammarians hare prefixedtothe ode the title “sd madentem?
no doubt ander the samo impr‘essiou. 'l’he foundation of this opinion appears te have
been the statement of Acron: ·‘ Hanc oden in satisfactionem facit amicae snae, imitatus
Stesichorum poetam Siculum qni vituperationem scribens Helenae caecatus est et postea
responso Apollinis laudem ejus scripsit ct oculorum aspectum recepit.” He does not
therefore say that Horace imitated the ode of Stesichorus, but only bis example Itis
very probabis, as Buttmann suggests, they got the name bom the uest ode and put it
before this, which contains no name nor any clue ιο the person addressed. Some MSS.
have the inscription “ Palinodia Gratidius ad Tyndaridem,'’ sud whoever invented this
inscription must hare supposed the ode ιο have been addressed ιο the daughter of that
woman, whom hc larnpoons iu his Itpodes. (traquins' Scholimt affirma that it is ad·

among others Heindorf on Β. i. 8. lhanlreis decidedly of that opinion, aad supposes
this ode ιο hare been written about the sume time with Epod. xvii.. and for the mma
mock purpose. I think there can be little doubt in the mind of any one who reads this
poem, that it was composed (though not in seriousncss) with reference to some verses
Horace had actually written, and that itis not a mere translation of Stesichorns' or any
other poem, while at the seme time thero are Greek ideas in it, which hc borrowed

'I'he editions thatI have consulted I will not tire the render hy
enumerating. No classica] author has been edited and eommented
upon so often aa Horace. 'Phe editions Ihave always referred ιο
when a difficulty of interpretation occurred are those of Ascensius

been chiefly indebted to the judgment of my friend and coadjutor
Mr. Loug, whose advice I have lilrewise followed in many other

the throne that kings younger brother Tigranes, who was then living at Rome.
Augustus ιοοοοιοᾶ, and seut his stapson 'liberius Claudius Nero with ‘tigranes to da·
throne Artaxias. (Dion. ta o. t, 9.) Uberius did this, and with his own hand crewned
'ligranea (Suetonius, rib. c. 9.) This summary proeeeding was mede the mest ef at
Rome, though there appears to have been little resistanee. 'l'here was a medai struck
on the ocmsiou, with the inscription ⁴⁸ Armenia capta'’ Horace speaks (Iip. 12. ιδ) οι
tha Armenian haring fallen by the ralour oi 'liberius ς and Velleius says Armenia was ,
reduced ιο ιιο power oi ιιο Romans. lt had been so virtually ainoe the submission
oi 'tigranes' grandfather ιο On. Pompeius. [Velleius (ri. 94) says that liberius placed
Δοιονιιᾶοο on ιιο throne. See the netes in Burmsun's ed]

liberius appears ιο harahad a number ei young men with him, such as Titius,
Celsus, and Munatius, mentioned in this Epistle, and Julius uerus, ιο whom it is
addresred What little ean ιο said about the unt three will be found in the notes·
Oi Florus Porphyrion says, “Fuit satiramm scriptor cujus suut electae ex Ennio.
Lucilio, Varrone.'' From this Epistle (r. 28) we inter that he was practising to be-
come en orator or a jurisconsultus, aud that he wrote verses oi the tester sort; and in
· the second lipiatle oi the second bools (r. 59) we bare the saum information.

‘⁴ &umine tn gaudes, hie delectatur iambis ς
Ille Bioneis sermonibus et saie nigro.”

He may hare written Satires, but it would asem irem the last quotation that he had
not written any when Horace sent him that Epistle. 1r the &hahart is ιο ιο trusted
(and itia not likely ιο invented what ιο says), Florus publisheda salectiou from the
old writers mentioued hy Porphyrion. Quintilian(1nst. Orat. x. 8) tells an anecdota
ei oue Julius Florus who was unele to an intimate friend oi his, Julius Secundus, and
whom ιο calls “ in eloquentia Galliarum (queniam ibi demum exercuit earu) princepa.”
This may be the person Heraea sddreases, sud isso he carded out meeoesfnlly the pur·
suit oi which Horace hare supposes him to ιο beginning the practice. Ηο is also sup·
poaed by Weicbert ιο ιο ιιο person mentioned by Tacitus (hun. iii. 40, 48) as the
leader of an inmrrection ef ιιο Ἰιονὶτὶ, which is very improbable. How he gettha
gentile name Julius is uncertain. 'l'he cognomen Florus belonged ιο ιιο Aquillia gener
and there was a L Aquillius Florus, one oi the ‘triumviri monetales' at this time,
moral oi whose coins are extant. Some ol them are given in the Dict. Biog. lt ia
supposed he roeeived the ‘ciritae’ irum O. Julius Camar and took his name. But we
know nothing about this. Horace had a great ragsrd fer him, as appears not only

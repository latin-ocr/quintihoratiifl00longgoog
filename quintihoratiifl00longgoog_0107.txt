OARMEN XXXII.

This edebas cauam the commentatore much trouble. Whether it was meant to be
an introduction to some poem Horace wrote or intended to write on one ol the events
oi the day, or what sort ot song be was aelred for and by whom, are all questions that
have been freely discumed. Τιο question turns in the first instance ou the worrl with
which the ode bcffl’ns. Τιι Schohusta read ‘Poecimun’ on which Acrou'e comment is
‘poscebatur dicta sua edere? Porphyriou's ‘Erigitur ι nobie ut muamus? But a
’ large number ol* MSS. have ‘Poscimue,' which Bentley adopts atter Lambinus und all
the older editions. (Graeculus, however, following his Blandiniau MS.. reads ‘Posci-
mur.') With that reading the ode becomes a mere invocationes the blase, which would
suit any poem or any subject. With ‘Poscimar,’ whichI have followed most of ιιι
modern editors in adopting, there is still ιο elue whatever to the occesiou of the ode,
and the Scholiaets' remarks do not help us. 1 ιιι no monade tor Dillenbr.'s supposi-
tiou that on some important occasion Horace was ashcd to write a poem, and wrote this
short ode to deprecate such a demand, and to show thet his muse was not suited ιο such
ιιιιιιι. Ι hare uo doubt ‘poscimur’ is the truc reading, und it may mean merely that
the poetic ‘afflatus' was on him. Τιι abruptueas of the opening saroam that notiou.

CARMINUM III. 2. 141

Virtus repulsae nescia sordidae
Intaminatis fulget honoribus,
Neo sumit aut ponit secures
Arbitrio popularis aurae.
Virtus recludens immeritis mori
Caelum negata tentat iter via,
coetusque volgares et adam
Spernit humum fugiente penna.
Est st fideli tuta silentio ’
Merces: vetabo qui Cereris sacram
Vulgarit arcanae sub isdem
Sit trabibus fragilemve mecum

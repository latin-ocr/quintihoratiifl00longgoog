though most even ci those who divide the colloqny at v. 6 have overlooked this diffl-
culty, and accepted ‘te’ on tha authority ot tha MSS. But ‘muta' is not properly a
common sailor, but ‘navicularia' a shipmaster. “ Nartem accipere debenus eum qni
navem exercet: quamvis nautae appellantur omnes qni navis navigandae causo in nava
suut. Sed de exercitora solummodo Praetor sentit” (Dig. 4. 9. 1. 5 2). 'l'he ‘exercitor'

v. 16, and for Archytas ιο begin (at v. ιι) with ‘hia qnoque devesi,' dc, nothing
haring gone before with which ιο οοιιοοι those worda is also unnatural; while, il wa

οοιιοιίοι with the gods and to the highest order ot wisdom that thoy hed ιοι escaped
death, not aven Pythagoras, though he pretended ιο have done so once) aad the grave
truth, colemnly propounded by the philosopher, that all must die, wise and unwise, old
and young, on land or at aea, and illustrated by his own case. 'lhis was once my

which Orelli inclined (though ho suspended his judgment on the whole question), snp-

Bran thee, thou measurer οι earth and sea, thou counter of the sanda, Archytas, how
small a portion of earth contains thee now! It proflta thee not to have aecrched the

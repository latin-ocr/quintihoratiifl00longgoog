GARMEN Ι.

Wunrs (iomar Octavianus had determincd ou the expedition against manuninum
cleopatra which led ιο the battle cf Actium, amo. ⁷28, ha summoned, ns we learn
from Dion Cassiur (ιι). 11), the leading senators and meu ol Equestrian rank tomeet him
st Brundusium, sor the benedt of their couusel aud (the histes-im seyr) to keeptba
Equestribus from mischius, und also ιο show the world the' harmony ιο which ha hud
brought meu of ull‘ordere ut Rome. Wbatevor tha motivcs may bave been, the fuet
may be accepted. Maecenas obeyed this summoue and went ιο Brundusium, but wne
sont baclr by Caesar ιο watcb over ιιο peuce of the city aud tbe affairs ol Italy, with
what particular powers, or under what title, history does not lnlorm us, nor is the

aleo, thera is evidence of the Sabina farm having come into Hornoe'e possession when
bc wrote it (v. 81). But that tbis did not occur till nster the publication of the first
book of Satires is certain, and it ir generally referred to amc. ino. 'lha opinion of
tha saura writer that Horace actually accompanied hineceuns on this expedition to
Sicily is notieed elsewhere (0. iii. ι. 28 n). lt· is very posible that Maecenas may
bave bad the offer of a command in the expedition against hl. Antonius, and that both
be nnd Horace believed he was going on that service, until onbisarrival at Brundusium
Augustus tbougbt dt ιο send him back to discharge more important dulles at Rome.
Horace, supposing him ιο ιο going ou this expedition, wished to accompauy him, bui
Maecenas would not allow it (v. 7), which gave occasion lor this lipoda

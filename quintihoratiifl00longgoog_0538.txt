Homer (odyss, xi.) mskes Ulysses go down to Hsdes and there meet 'lircsias the
'l'hebsn prophet, who tells him of the herdships that awaited him ln his journey home,
where however in tbe end he is dmtined to arrivs. Horace supposes s continnstion of
the interview, und musa Ulyssss usk the soothsuyer bow heis to repuir hia fortunus
when be gete home, and tlnds his property wusted by his wife's snltors, ss the prophet
told him it would be (sec note on w. 6). Tiresias, though he implica that the cunning
Ulysaes would be ut nu loss iu snchs mutter ifhc once got home, gives blm his advice
which isto lay himself out for pleasing old men sud women cf fortune, and getting
named in their willa, for which he lays down u few ordinary rules, cf which u perse·

who only know her as the vinnom wife and mother, will not easily forgive the course
sllusions to ber in this Satire. Sanndon and Dacier are anxious it should he understood,
that when Ulysses appears tc acquiesce in the advice of the prophet, he hus no intention
of demeaning himself so fur as to follow its “il sa retirs spris ls comultatiou sans
reponere h'lirtsias, et scus dtclarer le partit quoi il se determine ’' (Sunndou). Aa it
would bs difiicnlt to avoid condemning the whole construction of the Satire except by
understandiug itto be an estrswsgant turlesqne, we need not be at me trouble of deter-
mining whnt the intentione of Ulysses were when the imperions Proserpine shmptly
summoned his connsellor, and brohe cil the dialogus.

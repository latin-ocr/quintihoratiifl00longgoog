SATIRE I.

C. Taaaanms ‘lassa was a jurisconsult of eminence and a man of honour. [lle was
intimato with Cicero. who wrote for him a letter of recommendation to C. Caesar during
the Gallio war, and correspondod with Trebatius while he was with Caesar in Gallia
(ad Fam. vii. 5-18).] Ha was also in the conlidence of Augustus, who consulted him
on legal matters [θὶς. i. 2. 2 § 45 ; lust. ii. ιο] Horace secius to have been well ac·
quainted with him, though he was many years younger than Trebatius, and it is said
that hc was dead when this Satira was written. 1 nm inclined to doubt this, for
though it is possible Horace may have used tha old mau's name aven if he was dead, it
is more natural ιο suppose that he did ao when he was alive. The Satira is placed by
some chronologists aster all the others of tha aecond book. Franks argues from thc
allusion in v. 15 to the Parthians, that it must have been written in ano. 724, when,
alter the battle of Actium, Augustus was in Asia sottling the affairs oi the East (C. i.
26, lut). 1 think this is a weak foundation for hia assumption. Asl have said before,
tha conquest of tho Parthians was a subject the &mans oi this period had continually
before them, and to allude io the wonnds of the Parthian prostrate on the field of
‚ battle (“aut labentis equo describat vulnera Parthi '') would have hceu more natural
at almost any time thau when Angustus was carrying on peaceful negotiatione with
that people, without any immediata intention or prospect of coming ιο blows with
them. 'l'hat the Satira wis written aiter the eighth oi tho first bools is plain, becauoe
averse is repeated from that Satire in this (v. 22). Horace writes however aa if hc
were just beginning his carew (v. 60), fau of tho impulsas of youth, and resisting
the superior wisdom of his elder. As this is done only to keep up a little humour
in the scene, no particular inference as tc time can ba drawn hosa it. Became
Caesar iseallod ‘invictus’ (c. 11), Kirchnar supposes the Satira could not have been
written till aster the daath of lii. Antoniiu and the final establishmcut oi Augustos¹
power. Ha therebre mamas the dota auo. 726, which 1 believe to be much too

SATIRARUM II. 4. 491

dese ipso, llaec primns invenlt et cognovit Catius Miltiades.'' Hedoes not seem how·
ever to bavo observed that Catius is only representing the words of his teacber. But
as this person must have been dead many years before this Satire was written (Cicero's
letter was written nnc. 709), it has been supposed by some that Horace introduces his
name, though he was no longer living, only ss ι handle sor ridiculing the Epicuream.
Orelli suggests that Horace's Catius was sfrcedman of chamaeactes, and s con·
temptible person, notorious as a writer on cochery. Certainly a well-known namo
would answor every purpose even if the owner were dead, and the former of these two
opinions is probably correct.

Thot Horace chose novell-known Epicurean as the speaker in thir gastmnomieal
Satine, seems to show that he no longer held with that sect when he wrote it (C. i. 34;
S. i. ὅ. 101). That the followers os Epicurus went beyond their mostu- in commending
sensnal delights may very well be believed. It is usually the fate of unsound toacher-s,
that their errors arc exaggerated by those who profess ιο adopt them. It appears that
Epicurus held πολυτελῆ rirsa to be only recondary pleasures, οὐκ ἀναγκαίαις that he
held aman should be able to do without them, though il he could afford them ho would
do well to have them3 aud indeed thet be had a good opinion even of tasting (Diog.
laert. x. 127-149). But his Romen adherente did not take that view ol their duty,
and under the sanctiones his name and school made good living thechiet' good, andthe
ert of cookery the art οι· lise (aee Introduction to S. 2 os this book).

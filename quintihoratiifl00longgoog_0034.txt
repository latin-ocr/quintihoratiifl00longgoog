C. i. l.-'I'be metro of this Ode isone of three, oolled ultor
Asclepisdss, o lyn'o poet of unoertsin dote. It eonsists of single lines
dividet thus:

--l-ool-ll-ool-o:
The mesore mdty fulls on the long. syllable efter the ond of the

seoond foot. There ere two exceptione only in Horsoe,ii.12. 25, sud
iv. 8. 17. The Greeks did not follow this rulo, end their lines wore

less monotonous in oonseqneneo. The division of this metre by
ebosismbi is against the obvious rhythm. O. iii. 30, iv. 8, belong to

therme.

0. i< 2.-This metro takes its nome from Sappho. It oonsists of
stanno of four verses sseh 'Ibe tirst three ere elike, und oonsist of
four troohses, with o dsetyl in the third pisos. Homee slwsys sub·
stitutes s spondeo for the seeond trocheo, with one unoertsin emption,
0. 8. 70. The fourth verse eousists of e dsotyl ond spondes, ond is
nomed sn Adonis.

Thisis one of the eommonest metros. It differs in Hersee‘s hnnds
from the Greek usage by the less frequent introduction of the troohes
in the seooud phos, end from the eeesurs usually falling oster the

xxviii INTRODUO'PION.

in hie bande, end here possed into o amootb monotony, which none
but en emceculcted tacte con admire when compared with the Greek
' originale. Some may doubt whether the defect does not lie in the
languuge, and perhaps income degree it does ς but the later Sepphic
Odes ure more like the Greek in point of rhytbm, end cre so fer an
rmprovement upon the earlier ones Some of the more didicnlt long
metues heve been es euoeesefnlly imitated aa the lenguage allowed, bnt
many heve not been attempted.

Horace'e religione opinions heve been o good ded diacnsoed Bnt he
does not appear at any time to heve been very decided in hia opinione.
He was upwards of forty when he declared of himself thot he was like
e ship driven by a tempeet, going thie wey 11· thet, according aa the wind
happened to set. He was now a rigid moralist, now e materialiet, now
e Stoic, now au Epicurean, now a Oyrencic. To jndge him by hia own
writingr, he seems to heve thought thot the enjoyment of the present
honr was the end of man’s life. He nowhere pute forward 111111111ρί-
ness of another world aa the compenseticu for the inequalitiea of thia,
nor does he mcke any allusion 1ο another state of existence at all,
except in the ordinary fcbuloue wey. The certainty of death end the
uncertainty of life are only arguments with him for making the most of
the pleceurea we possess, but cll in the wey of moderatior, which is a
common-ploce much dwelt upon by Horace, cs ulso is the possession and
⁴ use of richer. Once, if werre totske him at hia word, he wce atartledby
a etorm, end induced lium an idler to become aerioua3 thetis, to put
awey the doctrines cf Epicurus, for what length of time we do not know.
But of systems he appecrs to have known little. He ridicules them cll
in their turn.

Afier Maecenas hed given him his ferm, he lived there e good decl
and improved it et much expenso. He had a liking for the country,
end has some beautiful descriptione of it. But when in the country he
no doubt felt lonely, and missod the tables ond society of bis city friends.
He dined 1 good decl with rich people, buthir own fore ct home was of

“ the simplest kind. He describes hie daily life in the city, when 111

happened to be disengaged, in the aixth Satire of the first book. His
heclth was indifferent, ae before observed. His eyes in particulcr
troubled him. He speaks of himself ns grey before his time. Suetonius
says he was short and fat, and he describes himself good humonredly
as a 111 cample of a hog iiom Epicurus’ sty (Epp. i.4. 16). Augustus
rallies him ou hie stature, in a letter of which pert is given in Suetonius'

1111 11 Horace.
The life of Horace was written by Porphyrion, the Scholiast fro·

quently referred to in these notes. He mentions thet memoir himself:

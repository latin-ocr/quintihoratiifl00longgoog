CARMINUM ΙΙ. la. 115

Quid quisque vitet nunquam homini satis
Cautum est in horas: navita Bosporum
Poenus perhorrescit neque ultra 15

Robur ς sed improvisa leti
Vis rapuit rapietque gentes. 20
Quam paene furvae regna Proserpinae
Et judicantem vidimus Aeacum
Sedesque discretas piorum et ’
Aeoliis fidibus querentem

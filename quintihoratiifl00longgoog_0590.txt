EPISTOLARUM Ι. 1.

Perdocet, haee recinunt juvenes dietata senesque,
Laevo suspensi loculos tabulamque lacerto.
Est animus tibi, sunt mores et lingua fidesque 3
· Sed quadringentis sex septem milia desunt,
Plebs eris. At pueri ludentes, “Rex eris,'' aiunt,
“Si recte lacios.” Hic murus adaeus esto,
Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa.
Roscia die sodes, mehor lex an puerorum est

Nenia, quae regnum recte facientibus offert,

Et maribus Curiis et decantata Camillis?

Isne tibi melius suadet qui rem iacias, rem, ta
Si possis recte, si non quocunque modo rem,

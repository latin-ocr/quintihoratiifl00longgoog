poesnnt⁸ss” Nor do Ι think he is muoh more happy, in most in·
stanoea (especially in the Odes), in his ehoioe of readings than in v
his eonjeetnres. He was always liable to be misled by want of ear
and poetieal teste, as well aa by the exeess of a prurient sageeity
and an unbounded egotism. 'l'ho text in this edition will be found to
differ less from Orelli’s than from any other. Where it does so the
reason is, Ι think, always given in the notes. He eollated some
exeellent MSS, especially three in the library at Berne, of which
the oldest he plaoes et the end of the eighth century or the be-
ginning of the ninth, end the other two in'the tenth. His other
MSS. were one of St. Gallen nearly complete, and another ot
Ziirieh eontaiuing the Odes, Epodes, end Ars Poetioa, both ot
whioh he says are of the tenth oentury. Other MSS. referred to
in these notes are the Vatioan end other Roman MSS. oollated by
Pes (1811) 3 twenty-three MSS. in the Royal Library at Paris
eollated by Pottier (1823), varying in age from tho tenth 10 the
thirteenth eentnry 3 end sundry others quoted with or without
name by Isambinns (1577 ⁶) , Oruquins (1611 ⁶), Torrentius (1608 ⁶),
and Bentley (1711). 01 the last the most important are four
eollnted by Crnquius, and known as the Blandinian MSS. belonging
to the rnonks 01 e Beuedietine monastery in Flanders, and whieh
were very soon atterwards destroyed with the monastery by lire.
The oldest 01 these, wbiobis appeeled to as a great authority, but
which was eertainly more often wrong than right in the instanoes
in whieh Cruquius quotes it, was said to be earlier than the ninth
eentnry. On the margin ol this MS. Crnquius found some old
notes, whieh, as he says, with infinite paine he deeiphered, and he
has added them to his own eommentary in a separate form. These
seholia are referred 10 under the abbreviated title 01 Comm. Cruq.
'l'ney are chiefly made up of the oommentaries 01 Acron and Por-

phyrion, with some additions apparently from other old authori-
ties 'l'he readings 01 these three Scholiasta help out the MSS,

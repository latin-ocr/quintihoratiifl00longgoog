'Ibis ode ιιι probably written ou ιιι ιιιιιι of Oreser Οοιιιίιιιιι [cenred Αιςιιιιι,
ιο. 87] ιο Roma, ester the taking of Alexandria. when the civil wars were ended, and
ιιι temple of danus was shut, nno. 725. Horucc expresses the opinion which Tacitus

(hun. i. 9) ιιιιιι ιιι held by reflseting meu of ull parties, “non aliud discordantis

ζ pohise remedium fuisse quarn ut ab uno regeretur,’' that the only remedy left for the

troubles of the ιιιιι was nn obsolute governmsnt iu the hands of one person. He ιιι
baeu charged with deserting his republican principles, end eren urging the destruction
ef tboes whose party he hed once belonged to, end with whom he had fought at Philippi.
But Horace nrgm reform, uot bloodebed3 end hc had lived long enooghto ιιιιιιι reform
ιιι not ιο ιι expected at the hands of republican lesders, or from any but him whose
genius was now in the eseeudmt. It is not therefore in ιι] numu spirit that he urges
Oeterianus ιο take upon hmself the tsslr of r'educing ιο order ιιι elemento of the
stata, which so many years of civil war hod throwu into confusion—Nous of Horaee's
οιιιιιι more justly celebrated than this for ιιι imagery it contains, forits gounim
feeling, end for the delicacy with which it flsttsrs Οοιιιίιιιιι, inresting him with divine
attributes, but inriting him to exorciso them ιι a father correcting rud dcfending his
children and thus ιο arengo in the noblest manner his great-andefemurder. The
way in which ιι introduces the name of Οιιιιι· unerpectedly ιι the end ιιι always
uppenrod ιο me an instencc of consummato ιιι.

'lhe prodigies described ιι ιιι beginning of this ode ιιι those which were said to ιιιι
followed the death ef C. Julius Caesar. They ere related ulso by Virgil, Georg. i. 466-
489, which passage, and the verses thet follow it ιο ιιι end of the hook, shouldberesd iu
connexion with this ode. It will appear ιο any resder of both very probuble that Horace
ιιι thir description iu his mind when he wrote. lt has been thought thot Horace could
not heve referredtoprodigics which hed occurred ιο long before (ιιι. 710, flfteeuyenrs
heloro this ode ιιιι written), when he wne ιι Διιιοι, ιιι therefore could not heve
ιιὶιιιιιιιι theru. Other prodigies therefore have been essumed ιι ιιι subject of ιιιιι
meing ιιιιιιι. Βιι ιιι only other occasions, about this time, when the 'liber is
recorded ιο have overdowad its hanla, were ιιι. 727 end hetthaeorum of which

years would be ιοο lete for this ode, in which the allusione to ιιι state of Rome and r

ιιι triumphs of Augustus (v. 49), und the propoeal thet he should assume supreme
authority, would in tbst case have been out of dcte and nnuwcsssry. One of ιιι
chicfpurpcses preferred hy Augustus was the avenging of his adoptive fether's deeth3
sse Suet. Ocior. xa “Nihil convenientius ducens quem necem avunculi vindicare
tuerique acte.” Tacitus also speaks of him (Anu. i. 9) ιι “pietate erga parentem-
ed arms civilis ectum ;'' which bis enemiea turned against him, ssyiug, “Cassii et
Bmtorum exitur psteruis inimicitiis datos, quenquam fas sit privata odie in publicis
utilitatibus remittere.'’ According to Dion Cassius (liii. ι) hir declared purpoee wer

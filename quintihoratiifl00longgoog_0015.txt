without however distrseting the reader by referring him baolr·
warda and forwerds to passages that will throw no light upon the

'l'he MSS. generally and most of the editions have inscriptions
or hesdinge to the different poems. That these were not given
them by Horeee himself is eleer, but they eppear in the earliest ’
MSS„ and are supposed by some te have been invented by the

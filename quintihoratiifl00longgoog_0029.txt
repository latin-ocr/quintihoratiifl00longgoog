xxiv IN'I'RODUCTION.

as it would seem, the sixth Satire of the second book, which book
therefore was not probably published till the eud of 724 or the beginning
of the next year, when Horace was about thirty-five years old

When Augustus returned from Asin, in nme. 725, aud closed the
’ gates of danus, being the scknowledged head of the republic, Horace
appeared amongst his most haarty adherente He wrote on this occasion
one of his best Odes (i. 2), aud employed his pen iu forwarding those
resorms which it was tha first ohjem of Augustus to effect (See Intro·
duction to C. ii 15). His most striking Odes appear for the most part
ιο have been written aller the establishment of peace. Some may have
been written before, and probably were. But for some reason it would
seem that he gave himself more ιο lyric poetry efter his thirty-unu year
than he had done before. He had most likely studied the Greek poeta
while he was at Athens, and some of his imitatione may have been
written early. If so, they were most probebly improved aud poliahed
from time ιο time (for he must have had them by him, known perhaps ’
only ιο a few friends, for many years) till they becarrm the graceful
specimens of artificia! composition that they are. Horace continued ιο
employ himself in this kind of writing (on a variety of subjecta, cou-
vivial, amatory, political‚ morah some original, many no doubt suggested
by Greek poems) till mmo. 730, when 1 am inclined to think the first
three books of the Odes were published. Icaunot here discuss the
subject, bnt 1 have considered aud stated in the ease of each Ode the
evidences, if any, that it contains of its dete, end 1 cau lind none which
msy not be placed in that year or before it. Bentley’s theory, which
limits Horace ιο one speeies of composition at a time, aud supposes each '
of the first three books of Odes ιο heve been published separately, Ihave
no faith iu; and he overlooks the fact that the twenty-fourth Ode of the
first book was certainly written four years aiter that in which he places
the publication of that book. Clinton, who supports Bentley (esst, Heli.
rae. 38), can only do se by supposing thet in the present copies some ’
pieces may heve been transposed, which is begging the question·
Franke hes arrived, 'as far as I ean judge, at the right conclusion upon
this subject. During this period Horace appears to hareupassed his
time et Rome among the most distinguished meu of the day, or at his
house in the eountry, paying occasional visits te Tibur, Praeneste, .
and Baiae, with indifferent health, which required change of air.
About the year auu. 728 he was nearly killed by the falling oia
tree, on his own estate, which accident he has recorded iu oue of his
Odes(ii.13),snd occasionally refers to. In the same stanzahe refers'to
n storm in which he was nearly lost eff Cape Palinurus¹‚ en the west

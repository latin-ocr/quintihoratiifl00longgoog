MS. sor ‘vetat' but if this is so, the preponderance ol the evidence
for ‘vetet’ ought not absolutely to decide in this passage. 'lbere .
are two objections to ‘ vetat ε’ one is the ferm ‘Teque’ by which
this lineis connected'with the preceding, which contains ‘ vivas3'
and the other is the difficulty of being certain about the meaning ef
‘laevus’ which, as some crities suppose, signifies ‘infaustus' a
meaning which is consistent either with ‘vetet’ or ‘ vetat! If
‘laevus’ significa ‘ auspicious,' then we have with ‘vetat’ this
meaning, ‘And thee neither the auspicious woodpeclrer nor the
wandering crowforbidsto go,' which is plainly not sense. 1 am not
sure about the meaning of 'vaga’ but I think ithus an inauspicious
meaning. 'l'he pamage is curione, and it might be discussed before “
a jury of competent men under the guidancc of a judge, who would
prevent the advocates from quarrelling aud abusing one another, as
eritics do sometimes.

Mr. Macleme observes that he has not accepted a single con·
jeeture made by Bentley. 'l'he'se conjectures, it is said, amount to
several hundreda. Aa far as Iknow, very few of Bentley's cou-
jeetures are now accepted by any editor 3 and this is a strong con·
demnation of a man's judgmeut whose great learning is dclmow·
lodged. It seem as if Bentley made many of his conjectures first,
aud then tried te find out reasons for them. These who know him
only hy his criticisms on Milton and his controversia! writings,
auch as the Beyle lecture and Philelcutherus Lipsiensis, may be
cuncus tolcam how he has handled a Latin poet iu whom propriety
ol expression and good teste are conspicuous. If Bentley's Latin
notas were hanalatcd into English, men who are not scholare, but
have plain good sense, would find something ol the same kind that
they might have secu before iubis English writings. It is true
that the notes on Horace did not allow him quite so good an oppor-
tunity of venting his eearse wit aud bad teste as his attach on the
Discourse on hbeo-thinking by Antony Cellius, the friend os John '
buche} buthe has done enough in his Horace to show his great
deiecta, and young men should be warned against being deluded by
a profuse display of learning, which is frequently used te support a

perverse ingenuity. Bentley¹s powers of assertieu were strong: his

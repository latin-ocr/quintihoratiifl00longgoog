EPISTOLARUM I. 2. 559

dud ιιοιιι. What appears ιο ιιιο struck him most on his leet pernral οι ιιι Iliad
uas the reolless selflehness οι the leaders and their indifference to tha salieriugs their
petty sqaabbles occasioned ; while the Odyssey he jndges te have been written with
tha intention οι representing a picture οι patient aad wisa endurance in the person οι
Ulyssea as an exemplato all ages. Horace considers the valae οι the Homeric poema
to lie in ιιι living picturas they present to the mind ; that they taught wiadom by
exemplos. He says nothing οι the poetry ιιι the artistic character οι these eom· ⁴
positions, in which their rcal merit consiste. As a pisce οι criticism therefore Horaoe's
remarks sre worth nothing. They arc akin ιο the allegorical interpretation οι Homer
which treated his worlrs as an inexhaustible fonntain οι wisdom, and overlaid the ι
critical with a fancifnl view. That a senaible man might get some good lessons hom
ιιι Iliad and Odyssey ia aaying ιο more than may be said οι any works in which
character is drawn in so many various shapes. But that ιιο predominating impreasion
οι the mind οι a men like Horace, with good teste and senae, aster a continuone
peruaal οι Homer, should be that which is here given is not easily accounted for.
Horace had his head ιιι] οι ιιι new stndy οι philosophy, and saw more οι practical
wiadom in these poema than in the writings of the philosophare end sophiets. ln v. 4
he reema to imply that Chrysippus and Crantor, aod such like philosophcrs. who
thought they got wiadom hom Homer by refining upon him, did not know what they
were abent 'l'heir teacher uus plain and intelligiblc: the fountain was clear, bnt they
made the stream mnddy, and the best thing a young man could ιο ιιι ιο read Homer
straight through and jndge for himself. This is the best interpretation I can put
upon Horece’s obecrvations, which at the best are not οι much valne, ιι bearing
οι the menits οι Homer. ·

ARGUMEll'l'.

While yon are declaiming st Rome, Irollias, 1 arn reading Homer st Praeneste, a
toacher above Chrysippus and Crantor themselves. For consider, in that lliad
οι his how he sets before ιι the passione οι priaces ond pcople: Antenoffs saga
ooansel; the selflsh obstinscy οι Paris; Nestor mediating between angry kings, one
lnflamed with love and both with anger. The princes err, the people sntl'er. There
is one scene οι treasons, stratagems, crime, luat, passion, in the Grecian camp or
within the walls οι Troy. 'l'hen again he hes given ns a bright example οι wiadorn
in Ulysses, driven over the earth ιιι eea, gethering experience as he went, snr-¹
ronnded with the waves οι suffering bat rising above them all, and shnnning the
char-ms οι ιιο Siren and the sweet poiseus οι Circe. Why, we ere but cyphers, born
only to est and drinh, like the saltere οι Penelope or the people οι Alcinous, who
slept ιιι danced and drove away care with the sonnd οι the wauton late.

Does the rabber risa at midnight ιο ιιι, ιιι do yon not wake up ιο guard yonrsell
from erili Nay then, ιι yon will not practice running while you are well, yon shall
do so uith the dropsy in your alain: ιι yon riso ιοι early, and give your mind to
study and ιο virtue, yon shall lie swale under the tortores οι cnvy or lust. Why
are yon in such haste ιο removea grain οι dost hom your eye, bot defer the cunng
οι your mind’s diseasei Begin and yon have half done ς ιι bold ιο be wisa ς begin.
He who pute off the day ol reformation is like the clown that waits till the stream
rnna dry.

But men are for money aad ease, end sor laying held to held. let him thathee
enough not wish ιοι· more. Riches will net take lever hom the reins or grief ιτοιι
ιιο beart. ἰιο owner should be sonnd in body and mind ιι he would enjoy what he
hasgot3 bnt he who is always anxiam gete no more good stom his riches thanthe
blind from epicture, the gouty horn a fomentation, or the deaf hom the ιοιιιι οι a
lyre3 ιοι ιι ιιο rosel is foul, whatever yon pour ιιιο ιι turns sour. Heed ιοι

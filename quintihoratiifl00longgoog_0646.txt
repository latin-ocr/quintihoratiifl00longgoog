EPISTOLARUM Ι. 12.

hermeus Agrippae Siculis quos colligis, Ioci,
Si reete frueris, non est ut eopia major
Ab Jove donari possit tibi. Tolle quereles3
Pauper euim nou est eui rerum suppetit usus.
Si ventri bene, si lateri est pedibusque tuis, nil
Divitiae poterunt regales addere majus.
si forte in medio positorum abstemius herbis
Vivis et urtica, sie vives protinus ut te

Ι Confestim liquidus Fortunae rivus inauret 3
Vel quie naturam mutere pecunie nescit,
Vel quie ennete putas une virtute minore.
Miramur si Democriti pecus edit agellos

Cultaque dum peregre est enimus sine corpore velox 3
Cum tu inter seabiem tantum et contagia lueri

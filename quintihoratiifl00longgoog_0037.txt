Ο. ii. le-'rhis Ode stands alone. 'lhe motmuhns its name from
Hipponax of Ephesus. The first verse consiste of three trochees,
followed by a single syllable, long or shortr

The second of tire trochees preceded by suchasyllab103

C. iii. ta-uhtsbhe- idda} {dms 01111- ht is usual to divide
it into feet called Ionic Minor ( υ υ , ,), of which the two first verses
contain four each, and the third contains two. Respecting this matre,

see Bentley's note. It would seem that Horace, imitating the subject
‚ of an Ode of Alcaeus (see Introduction), tried the metm also. The
Greek, as usual, has a much finer effect than the imitation.

⁸C. iv. 7.-'l'bis melre takes its name from Archilochus, and oon·
siste of an hexameter werse, followed by a verse which is the latter half
of a pentameter. There are no other Odes in this measure.

Epod i.-x.-The first ten Epodes are in the same metre, consisting
of alternate trimeter and dimeter iambic verses. They admit spondeos
only in the naeven places. Aa anapaestis onee introduced in ii. 35.

Epod. xi-This is one of the variatione of the iambic introduced
by Archilochus. The first verse is a trimeter iambic. The second is
ἆσνιάρπιιος, consisting ol' the last half of a, pentameter followed by a
dimeter iambic. This accounts for the short syllable in the middle of .

vv. 6, 10, 26, and the hiatus in rr. 14, 24. Bentley has a note on this
matre which may be consulted. ⁴

Epod. xiil—This metre eonsists of an hexameter verso, with one
' made up, as Epod. xi, of a dimeter iambic and half a pentameter, tha
differenee being that these parts are here reversed.

Epod. xiv, rra-These are composed of an hexameter followed by a
dImeter iambic.

Epod. xri-This consiste of an hexameter verse, followed by a pure
iambic verse.

Epod. xvii-This consiste entirely of trimeter iambic verses, being
the only Ode that does so.

The rulo laid down by Meineke, and adopted by many editors, which
affirma that the Odes which consist of single lines, or lines in alternate

measure, are to be divided into stanaas of four verses, appears to me
too doubtful to be adopted.

matter. Ido not feel that 1 have any peculias aptitude for thia
kind of work, and the same may be said of many who have under-
taken it. 1 have, however, noticed nearly all the veneficus in
Ritter's text, aud Ι think that some cf them are improvemeuts. Ι
have notioed also some of Keller's readings in the Odes, but 1 have
found very little iu them that seems ιο me of any velue.

When the manuscripts agree, and there is nothing unintelli-
gible, it inconsistent with the evidence ιο leta passage stand as it
is, aud it is inconsistent ιο attempt to improve it. When thereis
dirersity of readings in any case, we must determine which we will
acceptori abalauceofprobabilities. If uo reading gives asufficient
sense, we may endeavour ιο extract fromthe supposed false readings
something which does give a sense and may ιο what the copiers
would hare writtenif they had taken due carc. Many excellent
corrections have been made in this way, sud they commend them·
salves tc our judgment as true, that is, as posscssiug sufficient
probability ιο ιο accepted as true.

'there is another method which we may use in deciding between
conflicting readings, and also in determining whether a passage,
where there is no variation in the readings, may bc considered
genuine. In the case of Horace, for example, if we study the
general purpose of each poem, if we have made ourselves well ac·
quainted with his manner of expression and hia poetic colouring,
and ifwe fix our attention closely ou all the words of a given pas·
suge, aud the connexion of the whole passage with that which
precedes aud follows, we may often determine with great probability
what he intended to write, where the evidence leaves it doubtful3
and we may also determine whether critics are justified in putting
their own guesses in place of the documentary evidence, when there
iano uariatior in it. 'l'he power of justly interpreting is therefore
a necessary qualification for s critic who undertakes to settle a text
whether ancient or modern3 aa necessary as it ia for the commen-
tator who undertakes to explain hia author. 'lhere are indeed in
Horace many passages, where the text may be quite right, and yet
the interpretation is doubtful. Ι have found more of these passages ’
thqu expected, and some about which editors will always differ.

years, after the triumph ιο obtained for his victory orer the Parthini, an illyrian people,

tc dramntio writing. It eppesrs from Suetonius (de Illust. (iram. o. 10)thst he did not
undertalre his history till niter the death oi sinuat, suo. 720 (see Glintcn, Il. Η. a.
89 ιο), for it wes acer that event that he becsnre acquainted with the grammarian
Atteius, who iurnished him'with rules for composition. And ii the history was not
begnn till thet year, even though (ss is probabis) Pollio should have tslren notes oi most
oi the tranmciions he had ιο relate, with s great many ci which he had been personsliy
connected, it is not prcbuble thet sc large a work, consisting oi seventeen books, sud
taking in the whole period from the coaliticn oi Caesar, Pompeius, and Crassus ιο the
conclusion oi the civil wars, could have been so iur completed as ιο ιο communicated
ιο his friends before the year ιιιο. 723, which was the year οι ιιο battle oi Actium.
But the words “arms nondum expiatis uncta cruoribus” (v. 4 οφ), ccupied with
“cui dubit partes scelus explendi luppiter ” (O. i. 2. 20 sq.), make it likely that these
two odes were written about the same time ς that is ιο say, shortly ulter the bsttle und
before Augustus hsd established his governrnent in the confidence oi the pscple. Itis
truc lumbinus sud some oi the older commentatore were oi opinion thut the history
oi Pollio is not meant, but only his tragedics, which they say related ιο the events ot*
the times, and which Horace wishes him ιο lay asido ior a while and give his sttention
tc public affairs, until the republic should bs settled. So they interpret
— “mcx ubi putheas
Res ordinaris grande munus
Ceucpio repetes cothurno?

But there is no meson to suppose any oi Pcllic's trugcdics had reference ιο ιιο events
ci the dsy, while his history raisted ιο nothing else. The Scholiasta understood the
history to be referred ιο (οοο ιοιο on v. 10).

The cde was written aster hearing Pollio recita pert oi his work 3 u practice which
he is said to hsrc introduced among literury men ut Rome.

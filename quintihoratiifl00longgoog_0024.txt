Horaoe on thia occasion, audie neefnl again when he apeake of noar·

When we have long been aoouetomed to a reading, it ie very dif-
fienlt to aooept another, even if there ie better evidenoe for it, and
good reasons. 'Phua in C. ii. 20. 13, Keller hae ‘jam Daedaleo
notior Iearo.' Ι hardly know whether ‘ooior’ or ‘notior’ ie eup-
ported by tho better evidenoe. Perhaps ‘notior’ ie; and if wo
’ aeoept it, we eeoope the ‘Daedaleo ooior.' 'Still partly from habit,
and partly for other meone, Ι am not yet reeonoiled to ‘notior'

In C. iii. 4. 9, ‘altricis extra limen Apuliae,' the question of
‘Apuliae’ is hotly debated. The word ‘Apuliae' following ‘Apulo'
ianot the kind of repetition whioh seems to me to be an argument
agaimt ‘ Apuliae? nor ia the argument derived from the quan-
tity of the firet two syllables in ‘Apuliae’ oonolnaive. Itia a

'l'he boldeet attempt at alteration that I know ie in C. iii. 24. 4:
‘Tyrrhenum omne tuin et mare Apulioum,' where Keller hae ‘ter-
rennm omne tnie et mare publicum? and Ritter hae ‘Tyrrhenum
omne tuis et mere Ponticum.5 Bentley hae naid nothing against
theeommonreeding. ‘Terrenum’iehaehmann'a Itiaquite plain
that Horaee, noeording to hie faehion, wonld nae a proper name here,
and thehiSS. have ‘Tyrrhenum' or some equivalent form. Ithink
it ia equally plain thet the verse would end with nome other proper
name, and ‘Ponticum' ie supplied by nome manuscripta. Others
have ‘pnlionm,' ‘ publicum,' ‘apulioum,’ ‘ punicum! Here isa
oaae of real difficulty, but it isa most perverse aelection to ohooee
‘pnblionm‚' when we plainly require the name of a eea eontraated
with the ‘Tyrrhenum' Ifthe difficulty about ‘Apulioum'ie in·
auperahle, we mnet take ‘ Ponticum,’ whioh being a proper name
anewere one demand ol the text, but doee not eatiefy in other
respecta, for we want the name of a sea corresponding to ‘ 'Pyrrhe-
nnm' instead of being earried off to the Euxine.

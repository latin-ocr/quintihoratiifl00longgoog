SATIRE IV.

This Satira is an essay 66 good living put in 666 form 66 precepta delivered to Horace
at second haud by one Catius, wbo professes to have got thern from some sage more
learned in tbe nrt, but whom he does not name. Horace meets him accidentally as he
is hurrying away from the meessor's lecture to think over what 66 has learnt, and to
store it in 616 mind. Catius recites lium memory or from notes what he 666 heard, end
enters without prefeoe upon the question of the first course. The Professor may be
supposed 66 6666 carried his hearers through au entire dinner, “ab ovo usque ed mala”
(S. i. 3. 6 6.). Catius only gives the herda 66 666 lecture aud 666 or two of the sage's
reflectione. ’166 precepta he delirers inflame Horace with s desire to see and hear the
great man himself, and be prays 066166 teintreduoe him. It may be that Horace had
some third person in his eye, but 66 bave no means 66 knowing who it 666. 16 it be
so, there were those 66 doubt who would understand the allusion at the time. That it
was Maecenas Heindorf supposesr Wieland that Horace meant himself ς Acron says
be meant Nasidienus, but 666 Nasidienus was we do not know (S. Β. Introduction).
Coujecture isthrown away. 66 to the man Catius himself the Scholiasta eall him if.

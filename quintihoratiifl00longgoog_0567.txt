530 HORA'PII FLACCI

Alteresnts libidinibus tremis ossa pavore.
Quid refert uri, virgis ferroque necari
Auctoratus eas, an turpi clausus in area,

contractum genibus tangas eaput? Estne manto
Matronae peccantis in ambo justa potestas?

In corruptorem vel justior. Illa tamen se

Non habitu mutatve loeo, peccatve superne.

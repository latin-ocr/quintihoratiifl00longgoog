OARMnN XXIX.

In tho year oi the city 780 ιο army was sent into Arabia Felix hy Augustas ander
Aelius Galim, who was governor oi Egypt. 'l'he force chiefly consisted oi troops sta·
tioned iu that province (Strabo, p. 819: Γάλλοι Αἴλιος μέρει vestrm-yona φρουρᾶς els
τὴν Ἀραβίαν lamera and p. 780); bnt the prospect of wealth the expedition hold ont,
hom the iudednite knowledge then possessed of the country, attracted young meu at
Romeand induced, it would seem, lociusa man oi studione habits, tojoln it. 'I'he ex·
pedition was attended with disaster, and the greater part of the force perished, Iccius
survived, and we ilud Horace writlug ιο him a few years later as Agrippa's steward in
Sicily (lippi. 12). Beyond this nothing is known of Iccius. hluch hes been said
about his being avennicus, and that is the opinion oi the author ol his life in the
Biographioal Dictionsry usually referred to in these notes, who says that both in
this ode and the epistle“‘ Horace reprehends pointcdly hut delicately in locius an inor·
dinato desire ior wealth.'' 1 do not think this idea would have presented itself te so
many minds ilthe Scholiasta had not made such remarks as these: “Ad Iccium
scribit quem miratur philosophiae intermisso studio repente sc ad militarem vitam
contulisse cupiditate divitiarum.''-“ Parsimoniam laudat eum mordacitate '' (Aaron).
‘¹ Per qnod videtur concupiscere divitias Arabum.'’-“ Inconstantiae reprehendit qui
per avaritiam philosophiae studium militia mutavit’' (Porphyrion). Such mmarks
prove nothing and throw no light upon Horace'e meaning. 'l'he point is not worth
dismanng ss respecta the unknown Iccius; but the character of the cde is lost in this
view of it. lt is a piace of good-tempercd joeuler irony, oi which the point lies in
ths man of books going forth ss a conqueror ιο subdue derce natione nummed before,
and to return leden with the spoils ol the Enst. Iccius may have been of a restlcss
character and not easily satisfled with his position, ifwe may jndge of the language ot
the epistle; bat thot scarcely affccm the spirit ol this ode, in which there does not
appear to baany thing sanans espremcd or intended. Later times hare seen young
and chivalrons men hastening ιο an El Dorado in expectation of wealth aud dis·
finction, and finding nothing but disappointment, and such appears to hove been tha
caseon the occmion of this expedition into Arabia. ⁸

Jacobs has dheumed these two poema in his Loct. Venusinae, ars. i.. reprintad horn
theRhciu. Mus. lese, As the expedition was some tirno proper-ing, it isnot clear whether
this ode was written amc. 730, the year oi tha expedition, or a year or two earlier.

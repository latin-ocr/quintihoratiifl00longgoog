1111001000 10 1001010 writings 11000100 011010 few years. Horace did
agood deal to improve the Latin language, and 110 took the liberty,
which he defends, of saying many things 10 0 new way. . His
poetica] power was great and varied ς and if he had possessed more
energy of character, hc might have done 0100 mere than he 1100.
Βο1 what he has left is a proof 01 his talent. He gave the Romans,
00 101 as their language would permit, 0 set of lyrical compositione

both in matter and 10101 001 unworthy copies or imitations 01 the ⁴
Greek 3 and though such imitation is 0 confession 01 inferiority and

· sometimes is 100110 001 triding, he still shows that he could infuse

the vigour 01 the Iratin tongue into the measures 01 Sappho and
Alcaeus, and present to us 0 variety 01 natural 0111 pleasing
imsges in langrnge simple, concise, and expressive. A luat 0010101
reading 01 Ηο1000’0 lyric poema, 011010 long acquaintance with
them, has 01010 100 estimato them higher than I did, and even
when he is less successful, Ι feel more indulgence towards the poet
101 daring so much and doing it 00 well.

Μ1. Μο010000 has made some judicious remarks 00 1101000 10 his
Introduction3 and 0 recent writer in “ Blaekwood's Magazine'’ ,
(No. DCXXX.), “On the Causea 01 Horace's Popularity,’' has
written 00 instructive and agreeable essay.

But how 10 we know that we have what Horace wrote? A work
which has come down to us from 0 very remote time by successive
transcriptione must containpmany errors. Even books when they
have been 01100 reprinted differ very much from the original. 'lhe
general censent 01 the manuscripts 01 Horace isthe only evidence
01 what he wrote 3 and it 100 wonder that the diversities in the
text are 001 1001011100 they 010. Βο1 these diversities 010 sufficient
10 prove that 10 many passages we 000001 discover the 11001001-
ings, and we never shall. It is the business 01 the critic 10 use 1110
documentary evidence 01 the manuscripts, and 10 attempt 10101110
11001 the various readings some prohable conclusion. This 11101101
01 the critical art requires great labour, judgment‚ and teste, and we
are mueh indebted to scholare 101 what they have done towards
establishing the text 01 Horace and other 01101001 writers. Ihave
had neither time 001 10011001100 10 10 any thing 101 Horace iu this

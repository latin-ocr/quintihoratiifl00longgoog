Magnus Annus was generally believed in iscertein. Virgil refers ιο it in his fourth
liclogue: ⁸⁴ Magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo ’¹ (v. ι), “incipient magni pro-
cedere menses”(v.12)· Cicero discum it in his trcstise de bist. Deorum (ii. 20)=
“Quarum (i. e. of the planeta) ex disparibus motionibus magnum annum mathematici
nominaveruntr qui tum efficitur quum solis οι lunae et quinque errantium ad eandem
iuter se comparationem confectis omnium spatiis est facta conversio. Quae quam longa
sit magua quaestio ast. Fase vero certam et definitam necesse est.'' 'l'he statementa

explanation, which are derived chiefly from the statemcnfs ef Servius on the nh llclogue
of Virgil and from Censorinus, de Die Natali, 1 cannot say. But, without rcsorting ιο
such explanatione as the above, it would have been very snrprising if Augustus, having
resolved ιο celebrates great festival iu honour of his own successful career, had not
mede Apollo the principal feature of it, aad had called upon Pluto to bless his country,
in preference ιο that god ιο whom ha allowed himself ιο be lilrened aad whom his
flatteners assigned ιο him as his father. Horace appears ιο have been much plessed at
being chosen as poet-laureata of the occasion (Gis. 6, lotrad). The ode was sung at
the most solemn part of the festival, while thu emperor was in person offering sacrifice
attha second bour of the night en the river sida upon three altars, attended hythe
dileen men who presided over religicus affairs. Thu chorus consisted of twenty-seven
boys and twenty-seven girls of noble birth, well trained no doubt for the occasion
(C. iv. 6). The effect must have been very beautiful, and no wonder if the impression

on Horace's feelings (for in sil probability he was present) was strong aad tasting. ¹

Attempts have been made ιο distinguish the parts assigned ιο the respective choruses.
But there do not appear ιο me ιο ιο any conclusive or very probable data oa which ιο
found aa meante division, in which therefore, as might be expected, the editors do not
agree. 1 have endeavoured in the argument ιο show all the diviuous of the ode by its
subjecta. In jndging of the character of the ode as a poeticsl composition, it must not
be forgotten that it was written for a peculias and solemn occasion and ιο ιο set to
music, in both which points it differs from most of the other odes of Hereum and,judged
with reference ιο ιιοοο objecta, it may bs pronounced superior ιο laureata odes iu
general. aar rhythm it appears ιο me the best of all the Sapphic odes.

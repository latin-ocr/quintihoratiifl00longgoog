CARMINUM III. 27. 205

OARMEN XXVII.

'llic length oi this ode is more impoaing than the subject, which appears te be a jour-
ney to Graece (v. 19) proposed to be taken hy a lady of Horace'a acquaintance, whom
he pretends to detcr hom her purpose, by recitingthe dangers she will have to encountor
and the fate that waita upon female obstinacy, as illustramd hythe story oi Europe,
which story occupies two-thirda oi the oda, and thrusta Galatea and her Journey from
the soene altogether. Ido not see the difficulty of the ode that has arrested most oi
tbe editors. 'ibe length of the digression is simply a way with Horace (aa in the story
of Regulus, C. iii. ὅ, and oi Hypermnestra, iii. 11), and Pindar tecla the same liberty
with greater incedam. It ia a peculiarity which imitatore oi Horace will do wcll to
note, foris skiltirlly managed it would relieve the tameneas of many nn ode which, pro-
icssiug ιο bc an imitation of this author, has little but his rhythm and a few oi bis
phrases ιο rustain the resemblance. [Rittcr'a remark on the lady is a good specimen
of his manner of interpretation. Ii it does not instruct, it may amuse. “Galatea a
lacteis brachiis cervicequecandide nominata, olim Horatio carrajam virum divitem in
itinere comitari voluit. lter illud aut in Cretam imolam dirigebatur, aut a vlroe
familia Taurorum orto concipiebatur. Alterum nt conjiciam faciunt rerba (r. tol:
‘aie et Europe niveum doloso credidit tauro latus' (ut tn Taurum ecqui animum in·
duxisti).”]

By similar argumente Propertius (i. 8) detera Cynthia from going to sea, and Ouid
Corinna (Am. ii. 11). The Scholiast nn Homer (ll. xii. 807) says the story of Europe
was mooted by Bacchylides, whose poem bas not come down ιο nr, nor any part of it,
but was probably, as Orelli says, in Horace's hands. The Scholiast's account oi the
story ia just that oi the present ode. It would be difficolt ιο lind s more touching pic·
ture than Horace has drawn oi a young girl suddenly torn from bar childish amuse-
ments, transported iar hom the security of her home, and leit forlorn among strangera,
lmowing no tie hut that of ber famare love, to which alre instinctively turns with loug-
ing and sslf-reproach: her fault had been in giving way to afooliah impulse, but ahc sees
her crime through her seara, which magnifyit greatly by pointing to the probahle issue,
so that she looks upon her idle curioaity as nothing less than madness (v. 86). There
isalso great skssl in the last stannea in which we bave, llrst, the derisire laughter with
which Venus end her sou (whose bow is now nustrnng because it has done ita work, the
Scholiast says) break in upon the nnhappy girl ς theu tha irouioal prophecy in which
her own words are nsed againat her; sud, lastly, the serious consolation and congratu-
latiou with which they announoe her good fortuna, and bid her riae to it. 'l'lre pain
arising from her complaint is thus reliarcd, and waere leit with the conviction that she
ir reconeilcd to her destiny end prend of it.

ARGUMENT.

Lct the wicled go on their way with evil omens. 1 dobnt prayfor thee that thestorm
may be avertet. Be happy go where thou wilt, and remembcr me, Galatea. Fcar not

those idle omens: hut see the rising atorm: llrnow the dangers it portenda. May
they fall upon my enemy rather ιιιοο on thee. lt was thus liuropa leit hor girlish

OARMEN IX.

This is sn elegunt trifle (“ sn inoompsrsble dislogne.” Buttmann cells it), showing the
prooess os reconcilietion between two lovers, 111 which the desire for pesoe appears in the
midst oi pretended indifferenee, end mutual jeelousyismede themeonsof reunion. The
subject oould hardly here been more delioetely hendled. Whether the treetment os itis
original or not, it is impossible to my. Itis just euch e subject us one might expect to
find among the emec poetry of the Greeks· One of Buttmann’s remsrhs with reference
to this odeis well worth quotinge ⁴‘ 'lhe encients hed the skill to eonstrnet sueh poenis,

While Lydis wes deorest to thee oi women, the nome oi Iliowes not so noble es mine.

Though celsis is termemeno thou ert fiekle end possionste es the stormy seul

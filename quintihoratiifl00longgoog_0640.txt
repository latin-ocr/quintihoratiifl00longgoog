EPISTOLARUM Ι. 11.

EPISTLE XI.

‘l'hie lipietle ie eddroeeed to one Bullatiue, ol whom we lmow nothing. He wne
trevelling iu the hegoun eud in Δοὶο Minor, und woe absent longer thou Horace
wished, or thought good ior him; end the objeot ol thio letter ie to induce him
to return. The commentatore generally lnwe ο very menn opinion ol Bullatine,
who hoo suffered et their hendo hardel· mensure thun any of Ηοτοοοό friends.
But hir ohiei vioe οοοιοο to here been u fondness ior trevelling, rud on espeninl
admirationes rome of the lineet eud most ancient towns in the world. Ii we ere
to odd to thie thet lor rome reoeon οι· other he wer unhuppy, end expected to
relieve himself by change ol scene, he moy heve been miotulren in hir meane, but
if eo, plenty oi people have ihored iu hie mieteke, ond when Hornoe pute before
Bullntioe er the end oi lire the enjoyment oi the prerent moment-o doctrino he
eeeme to hore held pretty strongly-we moy doubt whether hie philosophy ir not
et leont oe bod oe hie friend'e preotioe. But we need not assume any thing injurioue
to Bulletiur. Such reflectione upon trenel ee occur in thie Epietlo might nntnrolly
hove euggeeted themselves whomroever it hod been written to. We murt not judge
Hornoele Epietlee oo we would private lettere, meent only for the reddinges the
pereonrtheynrowritteu to. ,

We heve no meane of knowing when the Epietle wne written.

Aeonum.

What think you, Bullatiue, ol the flno placeo of the Ereti ere they not ull temo
oompored without cmpos ond Tiberi Hero you eet your heort upon oue oi
httnlur' towns, or ure yon ro tired ot' trevelling thot yon uiuet rettle down ut
Lebedus, the dulleet ol placeo, noyon kuowl And yet 1 oould live thero will·
ingly, Ι oonleee, forgetting home end every body, to look out upon the stormy reu.
But the treveller who toruo in to hie tovern to ruet would not etny there ior even
ond he who wermr himself by the hre or ο hot bothdoeo not multe theee the eud
os hie life. So ir* yon hove been tempeet-tort, eud here been glud to pnt into port,
iethet eny reneon why you rhonld roll your ehip end never oome beck? Thone

“ purte ere very well ferrioli people‚ but oe longor heolth und fortune let yon be ut
Βοῐοο, etey here und preire Sumne und the rent ut ο dietnnoe. Be thenkfnl for the
bleeeinge of the dey, und live for the present houm οο will yon be happy whatever
plnoe yon moy be in. ’Τίο meon thot tehen ewoy sorrow, end we only οὴοοιςο our

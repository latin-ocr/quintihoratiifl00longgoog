HORATII Funccl

GARMEN XXVIII.

Agrest deul hus boen written sbout this ode, ss to the spirit sud purport of it, the
oeesnon of its eomposition, the persons introduced, und the ports they respectively beer.
The inore literully we take the ode und thelesswe sesrehforhidden menningo, or attempt
to fix the dete or the oense thot led to the huin of thought, the more likely we ers, l
eoneeive, to errive st the true bestingof the ode. Septimius, ono of Horsoe'smost
intimste friends hsd o ville st Tarentum (G. ii. 6), where it is likely Horsoe on some
oeension, if not often, psid him srisit Ιι seems ιο me not improbable thet he moy heve
seen sbodyesst on shore st thet plsoo where the soene appears to be leid. The sight of
this body might naturally suggest sueh sn ode ss this, in which the spirit of s ship-
wreeked msn is introduced momlizing upon deuth und usking for huriol. His reflections
tske the form, in the hrst instsnoe, of sn eddress to Archytas the philosopher, whose
nome wss sssoeiuted with Tarentum, end he joins with him other worthies, whose wis-
dom sud greotness hsd not seved thern thern the common lot of sll. There rney heve
been s legend thet Archytes wss huried on the ‘litus Matinum? generslly supposed to
be s pert of the rouge of lions Garganus in Apulis. Possiblys tomb wos shown there
thot wus sold ιο be his. But it does not follow thot the speaker wss there. The nume
of Arehytos would be suggested by his sssoeiution with Tarentum, where Ι think (from
v. 29) the soene is lsid, end the neme of such s meu is nsturully oonneeted with the
reflections of this ode, even independently of his oonnexion with the pisos. Thst
Archytas wss shipwreoked on ο woysge down the Hodristie (which is the genersl
opinion) hos been too hestily assumed honr this ode. lf he wss reelly buried ottho
foot of Mons (ismenus. there sre other wsys of seeounting for it. But the fuet is
not proved

'ihs ode hus the eppesronee st first sight of s dislogne, end the grest mojority of
eommentstors teke it in thot wey. Though differing from others ss to the division of
the diulogue, whieh 1 thought should teke pineo in the middle of the fifteenth verse, 1
wus ones of the sume opinion myself. 1 here now changed thet opinion, ond believe,
with Hottinger end others, quoted hy Orelli in his Essemus thet it is no dialogus
st sll, whieh view 1 sm the more disposed to sdopt, heoeuse it is supported hythe
judgmsnt ef my friend hir. Long. These who hold this opinion ere diridod in their
interpretation. Csssolm shirmed thet the ode wus merely the poet’s meditation upon
the fste of Arohytrs ond ou the destiny of sll great men: followed by sn eppesl, on
the pert of Archytes, for buriul (Ι suppose ot v. 21). Ldblrer snd lteesl think Horsos's
ghostis spesking under the funeiful notion thst he himself hod been drowned off
Palinurus (0. iii. 4. 27). G. Fabricius supposed the shsde of Archytas to be speaking
throughout. Hottinger (Opnse. Phil. Lips. 1817) ond Weiske (John. Annei. Phil.
1830) held the view thet Ῑ heve sdopted, exeept thet they supposed the unfortunate
mun, whose bodyis lying unburied, is speaking et the tomb of Arehytss on the pro·
montory of Matinum. I see no oeeusion for thot, sud think the suhjeot of the odeis
more likelyto here been suggested ut Tarentum then uny where else. The words
‘Neptuno custode Terenti' seems to ils the soene. If Archytas wss hesiod, or sup·
posed to be buried, et Matinum, it would he nsinrul for one who thought of the
nsrrow spooe to which his greetuess wss reduced ιο mention the spot where his bones
loy. But it does not spposr why s person speaking et Matinum should tslk of
Neptune particularly es the ‘eustos Terenti!

These who consider thet the whole ode consiste of s diulogne between s ssilor snd
Archytas divide lt either efter v. 6, or v. 16, or v. 20. They who melre the morines
essse to speek st v. 6, do so chiefly, beeuse the subjeets thet follow thot verse ere sup·

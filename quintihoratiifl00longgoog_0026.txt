Tne materiale for Horaee’e life are derived almoat entirely from hie
own worke. A few additional farte ane got hom a short memoir
attributed to Suetonius. ·

He war born on the 8th December, uuo. 689 (ao. 65), at or near
Venueia¹ (Venoea), in the Apenninee, on the bordere of Lucania and
Apulia Hie father wau a freedman', having, ae hie name provee, been

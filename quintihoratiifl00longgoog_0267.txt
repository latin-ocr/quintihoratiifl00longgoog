230 HORATII FLACCI

Cum leude victorem geretque
Proelia conjugibus loquenda
Karthagini jam non ego nuntios

Spes omnis et fortuna nostri
Nominis Hasdrubale interempto.
Nil Claudiae non perficient manus,
Quas et benigno numine J uppiter
Defendit et curae sagaces ιι

This ode ιιιι written amer the German victorico celebrated ιιι the last ode ando. 14,
and perhaps aeut ιο Augustus ιιι Gaul ι. unc 740. What were the reasom for the
Emperor'a protracmd abacum we cannottcll bnt we need not οιι that account gire credit
to the conjectures mentioned before (civ. 2, Introduction). lt ιιιιι perhaps the policy
of Augustus ιο make hia absence felt, and we may believe that the language of Horace,
which bears much more the impression of real feeling than of llattaery, represented the
sentimenta of great numbers at Rome, who felt the want of that presidiug genius which
had brought the city through its long troubles and' given it comparative peace. Ther·
could not be a more comprehensive picture of seeurity and rest obtained through the
influence of one mind than ra represented' ιιι thia ode, if we except thot with which ιιο
merely mortal longnugo οιιιι compare (Isaiuh xi. und lxv. Micah in). 'l'he Carmen
Saeculare contains much that ιι repeated herc Virgils description ιιι hia fonrth
Eclogua will naturally occur to the moder.

othere who were willing to give up a desperate cause aud settle quiet&
st home. His patrimony ⁸, however, was forfeited, and he seems
have had no means os subsisteres, which induoed him to employ himsel
in writing verses, with the view perhaps oi bringing himself into notice
rather than for the purpose of making money by their sale. It is no
impossible, however, that some of his earliest compositione were sever-e
personui satires and lampoons, written at the instigatiou of those who
were able ιο pay him ior them. That the book of Epodss which we
possess does not oontain sll that he wrote in Archilochus’ vein, 1 think
is pretty¹ certaiu; and the same I believe may be said of the books of
Satires. Probably his earliest efforts were more severe aud lieentious
than thom which his judgment allowed hini afterwards to publish,
though some of these are bad enough. With Archilochus aud Lucilius
before 'him as models, ond without the experience he afterwards gained,
his earliest productione may without difficulty be supposed ιο have been
such as iu later life he would condemn. By some means he managed )

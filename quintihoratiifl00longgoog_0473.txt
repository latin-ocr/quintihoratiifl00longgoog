11011001 Oruqnins has inferred that Horace alludes to O. Cornelius Gallus, the intimata
fn'end of all Horace's friends, and of Virgil in particular (1101. 1.). No opinion cau ba
more improbable thau this. Ont of tho word ‘Vitalium' (evidently corrupt) in Aeron’s
11010, Bentley has conjectured, with soma appearance of probability, that hl. Furius
Bibaculus is tha person referred 10. This poet, who was born 1101010011111652
(see Olinton F. Η. sub 111.),11 mentioned with respect by Quintilian (x. 1. 96). und
classed with Catullus and Horace as a satirist. 11110111111111111100110101(1111611)

the tls-st of these three reasons, aud 1 agree with him. The epithet ‘turgidus’ applies
to his person, aud 11 explained by the description 311011 of him in tha abore place,
“pingui 10111111 omaso.” Ha 11 said 1011111 murdered Memnon, and it is generally said
that thir refers 10 u translation he ia supposed tn hare made of the Aethiopis of Arcti·
uus, one of the eyclic poeta, in which Memnon was oue of the principal heroes. Dscier
suggests that he wrote a tragedy with this title, to which 11011011 the following lines
give some probability. Horace says that Furius, like some rude artists, had made a
figura of Rhenus witha head ef clay, referring 10 the statues by which the different
river gods were represented, and 10 some description this poet had given of the sources
of the libiae, probably in the abore poem on the Gallie war. Thero is avery different

deformare.” I do net agree with him. 1r ‘deformare’ were substituted it would
either haro the samo meaning tlrat 1 hare giren 10 ‘delingit’ or it would signify dis·
figures, which sensetlre passage will not bear. There is a chapter in Gellius (xviii. 11)
in which he defends Furius from the adverso judgment 01 Caesellius Vindex, who pro·
nonnced him affected, aud said hc had spoilt the Latin tangue by the invention of new
words, of some of which he gives specimena. The heading of the chapter malros this

Poet. 1110350 sqq.). Whataver the merita of Furim of nntium may hare been, it
inpossible he may haro used the expressions Gellius quotes, aud they would not be more
or worse blemishes thau one might find in most poenm 01 the same length (his Annals

Bibaculus 10 be meant. It is 01111011 however that one of the affectatione ascribed 10
the poet Gellius refers to, is “quod terram in lutum versam ‘latescere’ dixerit.” If
Bibaculus were tho nullior of this expression we might imagine that itlmd srael 10 hia

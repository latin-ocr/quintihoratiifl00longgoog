AltS POE'l'ICA. 111

Et tulit eloquium insolitum facundia praeceps,

Utiliumque sagax rerum et divina futuri

Sortilegis non discrepuit sententia Delphis.

Carmine qui tragico vilem certavit ob hircum, aaa
Mox etiam agrestes Satyros nudavit, et asper

Incolumi gravitate jocum tentavit, eo quod

Illecebris erat et grata novitate morandus

Spectator, functusque sacris et potus et exlex.

Verum ita risores, ita commendare dicaces

Conveniet Satyros, ita vertere seria ludo,

Ne quicunque deus, quicunque adhibebitur heros,

Reguli conspectus in auro nuper et ostro,

Migret in obscuras humili sermone tabernas,

Aut dum vitat humum nubes et mania captet. 230

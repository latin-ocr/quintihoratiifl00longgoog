Perhaps nearly all the learning that is necessary for the explanation
ol the text has been collected¹3 and future editors will do the best
service by applying ιο the interpretation of the text the knowledge
which their predecessore have transmitted.

Bentley osten employed the method ol interpretation todetermine
the true reading 3 and he thought that the reason os the case and
the matter (ratio et res ipsa) were sometimes stronger than a hun-
dred manuscripts, as he says ina note on C. iii 27. In his note
on v. ιι of this Ode, he maintains that ‘ rumpit,’ ior which there is
evidence, is better than ‘rumpat’ for which there is also evidence,
whether more or less‚I do not know. According ιο Bitter, the
evidence is for ‘rumpat’ 'Phia is just an instance which tries a
man's power, if he will venture to give reasons, and I think that
Bentley's argumentis opposed hythe ‘ratio et res ipsa! Bentley
says that ‘rumpat' is quite contrary ιο that which precedes (ducat,
ka), for it would be alucky thing for the wicked ιο break off the
journey which they had began, a lucky thing ιο return home when
they have discovered that they are setting out inauspicicusly. The ·
sense of the whole passage then, as he thinks, is this :-“ Iret
certain evil omens accompany the wicked. A serpent also is
wont ιο interrupt a journey which has been planned.'' This isa
very feeble addition to the first stanza3 and if we take ‘ rumpit' as
Bentley does, it means that a serpent interrupte any perscn's jour·
ney, whether he is bad or good. But the subsequent words, ‘ ego
eui timebo,’ are addressed ιο Galatea, and all that precedes ought to
apply ιο the wicked3 and Horace prays that bad luck may go with
them, when they do go, and thata bad sign may break off ajourney
which they have planned; and this is the same as saying, may they
not be able ιο go where they intend ιο go. There is no contradic·
tion here. It is not so easy to decide on the other passage (v. 15),
whether we should read ‘vetet' or ‘ vetat' Bitter has ‘ rumpat,’
‘ vetat :' Keller has ‘ rumpit,' ‘ vetet? There is said to be only oue

¹ Horace contains many words which have a techniecl meaning: they arc words of
art. There is one which 1 intended ιο ιιοιὶοο, but have omitted, the word ‘forme'
(Epp. ἰ. 16. 4), which, in the lenguagc of the Agrimcnsores,is a plen ofapicec of laud,
cut cn bronze, aud perhaps sometimes ou other material.

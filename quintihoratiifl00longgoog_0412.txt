11 tbe jonrney recorded in this Satira is certain, because Horace was not introduced ιο
Maecenas till the beginning 11 auc. 711. The same objection, among several others,
is 11111 ιο the theory which nannents the jouruey with the spring oi the year 716. At

cbjeot was rather ιο 111 what was going on than ιο take any active part. He came to
Brundusium, bnt the people would not let him into the hurbem (according ιο Pin-
tarch), and he therefore went on ιο Tarentum. Negotiaticns were carried on between
the two rivals (Caesar being at Rome) through 111111 employed by both, bnt without
effect, till 0111111 undertook to 1111111111 between her husband and brother, and was
finally 1111111111 11 reconeiling them. It has been supposed, with every probability,
that the mission which Horace accompanied was sent 1)] Caesar te meet Annuus on his
expected arrival at Brundusium on this occasion, in the spring 111111. 717. Tbat the
season was not winter may be inferred 1111)) 1. 11, where Horace speaks 11 being dis·

Horace started irem Boane with only ono eompanicu, Heliodorus the rhetorician
(v. 2), and they travelled together three days and one night, sixtycne Reman miles, till
they reached Tarracius or Anxur, where 1)] appointmaut they were 1ο meet the official
members oi their party. These were Maecenas and Cocceius, who had been employed
in negotiating the drst reconciliation between 011111· and Antonius, end Fonteius,
an intimate friend of Antonius. Three days asterwardstbey metat Sinuessa Horacc’s
three most intimate friends, Plotius Tucca, Varius, and Virgil ς one ol whom, Varius,
kept them company only sor six days, aud 1111 thern ior reasons which are not men·
tioned, at 0111111111 (1. 93). The rest of tho party went ou together till they reached
Brundusium, tlsteeu days 1111)· Horacehad 1111111111. The route they took was not
the abortest ortbe 1111111, which lay through Venusia and Tarentum. They preferred
taking the rond which strikee across the country irem Beneventum, aad, reaching tho
coastat Barium, continues along the sbore till it comes tc Brundusium. They were
evidently not pressed for time, and probably took the read they did because it passed
through Genucium, whither one ο1 the party was bound. Maecenas made his journey
as agreeable as under tho circumstances it could be, by taking with him anch com·
panions; and they all appear ιο great advantage in Horaoe's good-humoured diary.
There was no restraint 11111111 tho patron and bis friends, and their affection for him
and one another 11 is very pleasant ιο contemplate.

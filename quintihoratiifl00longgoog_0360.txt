LIBER PRIMUS.

Tus professed purpossei this Sstire, or thet with which Horace seeum to heve hegen,

msy be gethered hem the first two lines. Disoontent with the condition thet Provi-
denee hes sssigned them; dissppoiutmeut with the position many years' isbour und
perhsps dishouesty heve gained them, snvy of their neighbours' circumstances, even if
theymworsethun theirown t dissotisi'setion iu short with what they heve end ere, eud
meing sor something they heve net eud ere not-these ere features common to the
great majority os men. For this viee of diseoutent the Greeks hed the comprehensive
neme μεμψιμοιρία. lt ufforde a wide field fer nure, end could only be touched lightlp,
or in one or two oi its msuy peris, in the eompuss of one short poem. it wil] be seen
thet nster propounding the whole sth'eet in the shupe oi u question to hineeeuus,
Horace confines himself to oue solution oi it, und thet, it must be admitted, not tlre
most comprehensive (see notes on vv. 28, 108). Nor hes he managed the connexion
between his question sud the only snswer he gives it with very great skill. Averiee is
the only resson he essigns ior the nniverstl diseuse, sud sup oue will see thet hereby
he iesves msny uutouehed who ere us euipebly restiess us the smrieious, bnt uot in
their sordid wey. Howevsr, when he is upon this subject he writes, ss he simost
sivuys does, with elegunee und truth, und this is smoug the most popuisr oi Horeee’s
Setirss.
'i'he chronologists extruet s dete from the verses 114, 1152

“ Ut, quum carceribus missos rupit unguis currus,
Inetst equis surige sues vincentibus, —'’

which ere s little like the lest three verses in the first Georgie oi Virgiis

⁸⁴ Ut cum carceribus sese effudere quadrigae,
Addunt iu spetis, et frustm retinacula tendens
Fertur equis surige, neque ondit eunus hebenus?

'ihese verses iiersoe is seid to iusve imitated, und es this Georgic is supposed hy seme
writers to have heeu pubiished nuo. 719, the Setire could not heve been written before
thet year. But even irvle be eorreetly assigned sethe dete of the iirst Georgic, which
there ure no sufficient arguments to prove, it is not st uli impossible thet the sebove
verses sre imitated by both poete irem some common original, us'Orelii suggests Tne
lrhsness is uot great.

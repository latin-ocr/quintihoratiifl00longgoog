EPISTLE XVI.

Quintius, to whom this Epirtle ie addrceeed, cannot be identified with any known
person. The eume name ia connected with the eleventh Ode of the second beok3
hut there ie no reason to suppose them to belong to one person. There ie no
more reawn in the Epietle than in the Ode why a name should appear at ⁸1¹3 for
the subject ie general, that being the hebility ol men to be deeeiaed in respect to their
own goodneer and that ot othere hythe jndgment of the multitude. This discouree
follows rather abruptly a short description of Horece'r residence, to understand which
any body rrho cen get it should read the nobo capmartin de Chaupy'e ‘Deooaverte
de la Maieon de Oampngne d’Horaoe' printed at Rome in 1767. It ie written with
great rivecity and intelligmee, though, aa in ench caece must always be expected,
witha tcndency to atrain hia procis and to attempt more precision then the circnm-
etuncee admit.

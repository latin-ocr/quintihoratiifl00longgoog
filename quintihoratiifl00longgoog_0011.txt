1 have done my best tc determine the merits cf the various
readings, and to choose in every disputed case the best, according
to my judgment. 1 have given in anote the amount ol authority
for each ‹lisputed reading that I have adopted, and there is not a
word in the text which has not good MS. authority. “ Lectiones

have referred tc in the notes) as so many instanees of false taste
aad perverted ingenuity. Orelli, who was not wanting in respect
for Bentley, says, “conjecturae summi Critici, etsi semper sagaces

72 ’ HORATII FLACCI

CARMEN XXXIII.

'l'bs extent elsglss properly attributed to 'libellus mention only two mistrestes of his,
under the names of Delia and Nemesis, and thess ans the only two that Osid mentions
in the beautiful elegy he wrote on thet poct's death (Amor. iiie. 81, 55 sqq.). Of the
person he calls Delia he was saumonrsd during the earlier part oi his life3 uf Nemesis
during his later years. He died betusen thirty and forty, about the same time ss Vergil.
Much bas been written to prove that ths Glycera of this ode stands for Delia (sec par·
ticularly Spohn de A. 'libulli sits et carm. p. 50, 96, who believed thst Delia, Nemesis,
Glycera, Neaera-s name oecurriug only iu ths third book, which libellus, itis pretty
certain, did not write, were ull the same woman). Others have identified Glycera sith
Nemesis, on account of the number and quantity of the syllables being the same, and
the epithets 'libullusspplies to her, ‘avara' ‘rapam' ‘meva’ ‘dure' which comespond
te Horaoe's ‘immitia’ Dissen is certain that Glycerais neither Delie nor Nemesis, hut
another mistress otherwise unknown. Orelli isof the same opinion, but adds that those
who thus attempt to settle to enicety the loves of Roman gentlsmeu end pretend to*
know more about them than they have toldus, only creste a smile among those who
have lived long in Franco or Italy—implying thet his countrymeu were bad judgos of
the amusements of their more gsllsnt neighbours. lt is not even certain that 'Iibullus
wrote the pitiful slegies Horace speaks of. Glycera is one of Horace’s favourite nomes,
ond cannot be taken for a real name hers or elsewhere. It occurs in I’lentns (Mil.
(llor. ii. 5. 26) sud Martial (xiv. 187). Whether the person had any more reality than
the name or the verses, is, l thinis, doubtful. Thst Tibullus wrote elegias, that he was
not rsrely crosscd iu lovc, and thet he was on some occasion in a despondiug humour,
ure fecte sufficient to form s probabis foundation for this good-temperud little poma.
Whoever goes further tbnn this will flnd he is out of his depth.

Horace was much attached to Tibullus, who wass fasonrite with his contemporaries.
'lo him was sddressed the fourth epistle of the first book.

ARGUMENT.

Come, Albius, do not bc drswliug pitiful poetry upon Glycera, henaim she prefers a
younger man te you. Pretty Lycoris loves Cyrus, Cyrus inclines to Pholoe, who
adminss the vulger sinner astho shegout loves the wolf. Such ere Love’s divmnions,
bringing opposites under the yoke together. Scit happened to me-ss tendor beart
was attached to me, whilc 1 could not fiee myself from tho letters of Myrtale, more
crael than thewavesofthellsdristic. ’

38 HORA'PII rnaccl

mon, whom iambicus follows, supposes Horace is addressing himself ιο ιιο feam of
Brutus, and disanading him from renewing the battle at Philippi, after the death of
Cassius—a strange time for writing verses after the manner of Alcaeus, aad an unusual
way for a military tribune to oil'er mansel to his commender-inehief. Acron mpposes
Hdracc ιο ιο alluding to the designa of the republican party, under Sextus Pompeius.
This opinion is supported at some length by Bnttmann, Mythol. i. 848 sq, who argues
that the ship does not signify the oommonwealth, for that Horace speaks as if he wem
separated from the subject of the allegory: that ιο adriae tha citizens to abstain from
civil wara (represented by the sea), ιοοοιιοο they were in a cripplod condition, would ιοιο
imply thatthey might engage in them if they were not in that condition ς also that there
would ιο no propriety in representing the state asa dismastedship in thetimeofhugus·
tus. Ηο therefore considers that all this refers ιο ιιο efforts of the broken bnt restleas
party to which Horace had baeu lately attached torepair their fomunes under the leading
of Sext. Pompeius. ‘Nudum remigio latus‚' hc says,referstothennmberof theirbest rnen
ont off at and sium Philippi (he might have added the desertina of Menas). Τιο ‘desi-
derium' spoken of in v. 18, means thelingeringaffcotiou and anxiety Horace hadfor tho
party he had first cast in his fortunas with, and ‘taedium' the vexation he had suffered
in common with Brutus and all his best officere at ιιο stata of the republican forces at
Philippi. ‘Pontica pinus' he consideras very masterly allusion ιο Pompey the Great, as
the conqueror of Mithridates, which is Acron's opinion. 1 give this theory in deference
ιο ιιο author, who has few oqnals in critical sagacity, aud who in ιιο essay in which
these wiews are put forward has donc good service ιο ιιο interpretation of Horace on the
principles of common sense. Iahonld mention however that the theory has but few
supportem, of whom Gesner certainly is one, and his was nemean jndgment. Passow
is another. Pranke cannot sufficiently express his astonishment at Buttmaun's strange
doctrine. Having made up his mind that none of the odes in these three books were
written before Actium, ano. 728, ιο adopts ιιο opinion of Torrentius, Messon, Sans-
dou, and others, that Horace wmte this ode at the time when Augustus was thinking of
retiring from tha head of affairs (ano. 725), and when he was dimuaded by Maecenas
iu a specehin which hc likened the state ιο a wesaol tostupon the waters withoutapilot
(Dion Cass. 5216). Ιι does not soem to have ocenmed to Franks, that supposing the
historian ιο hare related the actual words of Maecenas, which is somewhat impmbabb,
is is as likely be got his imagofrom Horace as Horace hem Maecenas. But the image
was common and always will be, and it is aa plain as possible that Horace got his
notion not hom Maecenas but from Alcaeus. Besides, the cantione contained in this ode
tre plainly addressed, not tollugnstns, bnt ιο ιιο citizens, and so farfrom requiring such
cautious, they wana importunate in requesting him ιο romain aa he was.

Kirohner, who speaks cf Buttmann’s opinion as ‘infelicissima’ has no hesitation in
referring ιιο ode, with lipod. vii, to the year before the battle of Actium, when the
flames nf war wore kindling again between Augustus and Antonius Jani, Mitsch,
Doering arcos the same opinion, and Dillenbr. rather prefers it. Orelli is silent.

Maving now stated all the opinions that Ι hare soen upon this muohdispntod ode, .

lmust leave the rander to jndge for himself. That there was many an honr when
Horace sighed for pesce between the day he found himself established in his scribe's
office ιο that which brought Augustus homa in triumph is certain, and that he felt aa a
man of weak nervos might feel in a storin during the troubles cf that long period may
well bo supposed. 1 think lt iaveryhard tosay at what precise jnncture in those stin-ing
times the notiou entered his head of sitting down ιο write an ode in close imitation ef
Alcaeus, though wa may safely affirm, that the idea would only ιο natural while Rome
was disturhed, and therefore that the ode was written before the death of M. Antonius
in anto. 724- Of the theodos above ςὶνοο Ι prefer Acrou's.

'lhis work oi eorrecting Horace aad other writers still goes on,
and will go on as long as there are printersto print. Itis doubtful
whether waere going baekwards or forwerda in the antimi art, for ι
some oi the newest emendations arethe worst. We hare a proposal
by Lachmann and Haupt (Keller) to write ‘'lhynus' for ‘Poenus’
in C. ii. 13, 14. Ido not lmow what objection these critice made
to ‘ Poenusz’ Bentley has let it pass unmolested. ‘ Thynas' was
probably suggested by ‘'l'hyna merce’ (C. iii. 7. 3), and ‘Bithyna’
(Ο. ἰ. 35. 7; Epp. i. 6. 33). Here the argument turns entirely on
the propriety of the expression ‘navita Bosporum Poenusr’ the
evidence is for the common reading. Horace continually uses
proper names to give life and complexion to his poetry, and there
are instances in which he uses them, as far as we can sse, where
other proper names would do as well if they had suited his verse.
If the ‘navita’ must hare some life put into him hya name, Ι could

not think of one better than Poenus, whether Horace used it in the
larger armore limited sense, nor is the poet wished to put his
‘navita' on the road to some great and distant seat of commeroe,
could he have chosen a more troublesome course for him than beat-
ing up the Bosporus against a strong current. What the ‘navita
Thynrrs' would be doing there 1 cannot tell, as the Thyni were not

¹ Thera is an example ol Bentley's perverse argumentation on lipod. xv. 15, where,
aster proposing aad deiending ‘offensi’ instead of ‘offensae' at the aad of his note ha
says that ‘offensae’ may stand, ii a man will interpret it as he dass. His interpreta-
tion may certainly ba accepted. In S. i. 9. 1, he inserts ‘ut’ aiter ‘ibam' because he
dosa not like the expression ‘ibam’ alone, and he defends hia ‘ut' by quoting among
other passages enodem ramnes, Phormio, ir. &122 ‘Utabii abste, tit forte ebriam mihi
Phormia' which is quite adiffemat thing. In the same satire, v. 36, he puta ‘vadatus'

is nsed absolutely, and hs giras exemplar, ol which there are plenty, but not one whom
the word ‘vadari’ occurs. ‘Respondsmvadato' would bc aa regalaras‘rcspondere

formity by changing ‘vadato’ into ‘ vadatus,’ aad giving to ‘ radatus’ a passive signi·

aster his time. It baa been suggested that ‘vadato' isan ablativa in a passive sense
(Kriiger), a suggestion ln which there may be something ς aad it leaves the geuulm
reading untouchod.

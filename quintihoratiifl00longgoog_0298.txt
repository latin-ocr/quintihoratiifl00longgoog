CARMEN SAEOULARE.

-ss— ’

Wnsn Angustus had completed the period of teu years for which the imperial power
uas at oras placed iu bis hands (nno. rer-7³⁷), he determiued to celebrate his auc·
cess at home and ubroad by an extraordinary festival, and lie took us hia model the
Ludi Tarentini or Taurii, which had iu former times been obserred as a means of pro·
pitiating the infernal deine, Dis and Proserpina, on ocosnione of great public calami·
ties. lt does not appear that this festival aver was held at regular iuter-vals. How
therefore the name Ludi Saeculares arescis not cleers but as itwaa now for thelirst time
giren it vras probably convenient to bave it believed that the gemes were nc more thau
the οοιοτοαοοο of a periodical solemuity. 'l'bc Quindecimviri were ordered to consult
the Sibyllina books, aud they reported, uo doubt aa they were desired, that the time was
come when thia great national festival should be repeated, and the details oi it were
laid down in s set of hexameter Greek remes, which have been preserved by the histo· “
rian fecimus, vrbo gives a description oi the festival (ii. 5). [mimus names the verses
sistentiam menie: and he says that they bare been reported by ethera before
him] The verses will be found at the end of the odo.

Since Dis and Proserpina were the divinitias chiefly iusolred iu the ancient gemes,
the question ariam, Why vere Apollo and Diana the leading deities on this occasioni
If it be admitted that the festival was observed aa a matter of convenience aud not
from any religione feeling, it is not difficolt to understand that tha older precedente
uera only generally adopted, and the deities most in fashion suere as s matter of course
substituted for the obsoleta Dis and Proserpina. Augustus considered himself especially
under the preteetion of Apollo, and the attributes assigned iu the olden time to the
infernal deities‚ as the odginators and avertere ef physicsl erile, had by this time been
mamonae tc Apollo aud bis sister aa representing the sun and moon, as Mitseberlich
has cbserved. Orelli ou this point quotes with approval some remarks of Jahn chirg.

among the Etruscam and Romans that the universe was mering iu ecycle the com.

into ten months or ages (saecula), the length ef which vas not defined but uas declared

accounts for the irreguler celebratlon of the Saecular gemes at Rome. ‘llas Sibyllina

these dirinities ware worshipped rather than others, because cn the uppem-auce of the

ARS POETICA.

Vicinus urbes alit et grave sentit aratrum,

Seu cursum mutavit iniquum fmgibus amnis

Doctus iter melius, mortalia-facta peribunt,

Nedum sermonum stet honos et gratia vivax.

Multa renascentur quae jam cecidere, cadentque

Quae nuuc eunt in honore vocabula, si volet usas,

Quem peaes arbitrium est et jus et norma loquendi.

Res gestae regumque ducumque et tristia bella

Quo scribi possent numero monstravit Homerus.

CARMINUM 1. 3.

OARMEN III.

Τιο dote οι this ode bus been mooh disonssed. It isthe ohmnologists’ stumbliug·
bloolr. li it was written οι the oeossion oi tbst royoge to Athens from which Virgil
only returned to die, the ιιιο must be nmo. 735. How thet interseras with the
reekoning oi Frunke ιιι others moy ιο οοοι by referring ιο the introductory remarks
ιο this edition. ιιιιιο however denies thot this ode ιιι refereuoe to thet voyage.
Ηο esen thinks it doubtful whether it is sddrensed toVirgil the poet ς ιιι though be is
in generel very οοιιο ιιι judioions, his zeol for the theory he adroostes ιιι ewsy with
bis judgment when it led him ιο think thet Quintilius, whose death islnmeoted in C. 24
oi this book, is the person here eddressed, ιιι thet perhaps ιο was drowned οι the
voysge, sinoe it is olent, says he, from thet ode thot he met with ιι untimely ιιι vio·
lent ιοιιι. coming from most other people this theory would not be worth mentiouing.
Τιιι it isthe resortof ιι ιιιοοιιο indifficulty is olearon tbefnoe of it. Ηο thinks these
two odes ere oloeely οοιιοοιοι, though the ιιι ιιι ιοοι Ιοιι ιο ιι from the obseurity ol
the alludens, but be tlnds ι treee olit in the words “Neris quse tibi creditum Debes ”
(v. 6 οι this ode); ιιι (ιιι 11, “'l'n trustra pins heul non ito οιοιιιιιι.” 'lbere ls ιο
weigbt in this ergument ot ιι] 3 newertheless, there is ιο eertuinty thet the ode wer
written on the ooeesion supposed. Virgil moy hore medeor oontempluted ι voyage
before his lest, ιιι there is so much difficulty attending the ιιιο ιιι. 735 ιιιι 1 ιιι
inolinedtothiuls suehmust hore been the osse. 'l'his leores ιιοιιιο οι the ode in
uneerteinty. Frsnlo's best argument is, ιιιι if ιιο pobliostion of these odes took ploos
aba Virgil's death, it must here been immediately or very soon mer, eren eoeording

' to the chronology of Kirohner ιιι others who sre opposed ιο him r ιιι thet it would

beve been in the worst teste ιιι ieelingto heve inserted this ode ιι suoh etime. 'lbere
esu hs little doubt, 1 think, but ιο would heve suppressed it, or oooompunied it with one
expreuing his own ιιι the ιιίιοιιιι sorrow. Ιοιιιοι imagine egroster mookery then
the insertion οι ιι ode sddreessd ιο Virgil on the ιοιιι ofhis friend, ιιι ιι ode preying
ior his snfe roynge, ιι ι time when eli Virgil's friends must heve been beweillng his
dertb, to which no allusion is mede in ιι] pert oi Horsoois writings. 'l'his lust ieet
would be ιοοοιιωι for il we supposed Virgil ιο hore died during the time when Horeoe
ιιι almost il' not entirely suspended this kind οι writing. quke's attempt to show
thet there wer ιοι thst motuni sfl'eotiou between Virgil end Horeee whieh would werram
the expressions ln this ode ievery weel. But others heve offirmed the seme ιοοιιιο
Vergil nowhere mentions Hortos, ιιι ιοοιιοο hedid ιοι isere himhis literery executor,
ιιι οιοιο Verius sud Τιοοι rsther thun Homoe. But Virgil left hie AEneid not to ιο
published but destroyed, sud there is ιο reason why he should here ehosen Ηοιιοο ior
such ι purpose Amen moy hsve more friends ιιιι executors, ιιι does not always give
ιιιι offiee to those hs loves best. As for the other argument, if the ιιιιιο of Virgil's
poem be oonsidered it is ιοι worth notieing.

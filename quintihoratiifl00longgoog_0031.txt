time. It seems from the Epistls ιο Florus that Horace at this time
had to resist the nrgeucy os friends beggiag him ιο write, one in this
style aud another in that, and that he had no desire tc grstify them and
to sacrifice his own ease to a pursuit in which it is plain he never took
any great delight He was likely to bring ιο it less energy, ae his lil'e
was drawing prematuroly ιο a close through infirmities either contracted
or aggravated during bis irretional campaigning with Brutus, his inapti·
tude for which he appears afterwards ιο have heen perfectly aware οι.
Ηο continued ιο apply himself ιο the stndy oi moral philosophy till his
death, which took place on the 27th November, unc. 746, or no. 8,
in the thy-serem year of his cge, and within a few days of its comple-
tion. Maecenas died the seme year, also towards the close of it; a
coincidence that bns led some ιο the nonen that Horace hastened his
own death that he might not have the pnin ol surriving his patron

According ιο Suetonius his death (which ho places after his fiity· -mnth
year, as the text erroneously stands) was so sudden that he had not
time ιο execute his will, which' rs opposed to the notion of suicide. The
two friends were buried near one another “in extremis Esquiliis‚'’ in

the farthest part of the Esquiliae, that is probably without the city

walls, on the gruum drained end laid out in gardens by Maecenas.

The plan adopted in this Edition, of commenting on each poem in a
separate Introduction, renders it unnecesssry to say much in this place
upon Horace's style and character. The particular style in which his
principle strength lay will be clways matter os opinion. My own is, that
he is nowhere so great us in the Odes, and thst of these his genius ie
best shown in the Odes that relate ιο public affairs or men, while in some
ol the small occasional pisces, as the Ode ιο the Fountain ol Bandusia,
that on the death of Quintilius, and others, much grace and feeling
are shown. lcannot at all agree with those who think thnt amatory
verse-writing was Horace’s strong point With rare exceptione hie
compositione of this kind, however elegant they mcy be, appear frigid
and passionless, bearing the stamp of imitation, with unequivocal signs
of art, and none of nature. The crowd of mistresses that have been
gathered for him ont ol his poemsis beyond belief ; and the laborious
folly thst bas tried ιο classify his amonis, and to follow chronologi·
cally the shilting of his effectione, I hare had occasion to notice.
It proceeds upon un interpretation of the Odee which is foreign to
their true character. Horace was neither more nor less licentious pro·
bably than most of his contemporaries, though his biographer Suetonius
charges him with gross sensuality3 but, however this may bc, that the
women oi his ode are in nearly every instance fictitious I heve no
doubt whatever. Cinaru⁵ seems to represent a real person3 and with

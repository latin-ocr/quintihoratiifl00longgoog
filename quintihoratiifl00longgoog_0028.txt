INTRODUCTION. xxiii

more genuino in Horaoe's writings than his expressions oi affection t’or
his iether and for Maecenas. His gratitudo to Maecenas never takes
the form of servility‚ his affectim never savours oi affectation, and his
{amiliarity never approachea ιο impertineuoa. Ηο sees in Maecenas’
gists to himself only the genereus disposition oi ιιο giyer, of which he
hae no thought of taking undae advantage3 his patronage he neither
exaggeratos nor undervalues; ior his health ιο feels tenderly; his
danger he tries ιο share3 and his anxieties ιο does his bost ιο soothe.
It is erident that Maecenas ednod his society and understood his ⁸
ohmuctor.

At his house, probably, Horace became intimate with Pollio aud ιιο
marry persons of consideration whose friendship he appears ιο have
enjoyod. Through Maecenas also itis probabis Horace was introduced
to Angustus, hut when that happened is unoertain. In unc. 717
Maecenas was deputed by Augustus ιο meet M. Antonius at Brundi·
sium, end ιο took Horace with him on that Journey, of which arr amusing
oemunt isgivon in the fifth Satira oi the first book. Horace appears
tobsve pertcd from the rest of the company at Brundisium, arrd per-
haps returned ιο Rome by Tarentum aad Venusia. (See S. i. 5, Ino).
Between this journey and ano 722 Horace received from his friend
the presentet a small estate in the valley oi the Digentia (Lioenza),
situsted about thirty-four miles from Rome, and sourtoon from Tibur, in
ιιο Sabine country. Ofthis property ho givos adescription in his Epistle
ιο Quintius (i. 16), and ιο appears to have lived thersa part oi every year,
and to harebeen fond of ιιο place, which was very quiet androtired, being
four miles from the nearest town, Varia (Vico Varo), the οοιιιο oi tho
district, hut of no great importunes. During this interval he con·
tiousd to write Satires aad Epodes‚ but also, it appears ιο me probablo‚ .
some oi ιιο Odes, which some years lator he published, and others which
he did not publish These compositione 1 have no doubt were scen by
his friends, and were pretty weil known before any os them were collected
sor publication. It will appear from ιιο separate Introductions ιο ιιο
sevus} Satires oi the first book that there ie notens which might not
bave been written by the year noc. 719, and in that year Franks
supposes the first book was published. It may have been so, but
ihmke’s arguments aro not conclusive. In auo. 723 ιιο battle of
Actium was fought, and in the prospect of Maecenas having a command
on that occasion, Horace wrote him a tonching poem, which stands first
inthe book of Epodos. The ninth Epode was written immediately
estertho victory, aud thero is no poem in the book of Epodos which
need ba placed later. Iagroe therefore with ιιιιιο in thinking thot
book, of which οιο or two pooms aro among Horaeo's earliest composi·
tiens, moy have beon publishod in auu. 724. In that year was written,

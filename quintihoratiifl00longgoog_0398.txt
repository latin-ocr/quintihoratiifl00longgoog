SA'l'IRARUM 1. 4. 361

ARGUMENT-

(irent wer the liberty wherewith thoee worthiee cf the Old Comedy eet their mark upon
tha vicioue, und them Lucilius hae copied ς eman of wit and perception, bnt thorah
verdier, caring leee foc the qualityof hie werrae then tha quantity 3 full of werde end
full offeulte, which he wee too leey tc aroid. Δο to your quantity, I cure not for
thot γ and when crispine· challenges ma at grem udde tc try whlch of ne can write
quickeat, I decline tha invitation, and thank heaven thet 1 arn a men of quiet tem·
perennent und few werde. lle may gc cn pulling and blcwing like u pair cf ballcwe,
but that ie not in my way.

(e. 21.) Faunine gete e taetimonial from hie admirere, while nc one will recd whatl
write (ond I am too nerroue to recita it in public), οοοοοοο men do not like to huwe
their faulte exposed, und there ure few who arc not open to blame. 'lale any man
ont of a crowd, he ie avaricioue, cr ambitione, or lechemne, or ha dotce upon fine plata
oriine etatuee, or ie running about the world to maire hie fortune. All euch era
afrnid of verace lilre mine, ond hate thoae whc write them. “Tele ca're cf him ς οο

iedangeroue3 all he ceree fcr ie to get up a iangh and amnne the oid women and ’

children at the expanac of bie friende.”

(v. 38.) Now lat ma eey a word in reply. ln the llrat place 1 do not profare to be a
poet. Sir feet in a werre which otherwiee ie mere proee, thie duee not mulce a poet,
butgeuiue, inepiration, and sublime langnage. And thie hee led acme to queatiou
whether comedy ie poetry, eceing that the lungunga und ideae arc all thone cf com-

· mon life. lhera ara your fathore, for instance, ecolding their οοοο, jnet ae yon may

herr every dey 3 mureowar you may ahnffle the werde oe yon pleone in true peetry

without ultering the aenae, but thatin not the cuae with aniliue’ langnege aud minc

(you muet read it aa yon would prore, or yon melre ncneenee of it).

(w. ee.) But thie qnaaticn Imeydiecnee eleewhere. ldy present purpose ie to ehow that
you huwe no rcueou tc be theid cithia cort cf writiug. There are your informare
who go about and ara the terror of all roguee= the honeet man may deapiee them.
But, even euppoeing yon are the regne, 1 am no informer. I huuc no deeira to hare

my booke thumbed by the vulgar, or to read them tc eny but my friends, and thot
only when preat. 'l'here are many Ι grant you who bawl their verace in thafurum
and in the public betha, bnt they are mere bloclrhcade. “But we know yon lore to
annoy, und dc it with meliciom intent.” How cen you charge me with thiel Ney,
the man who elandere hie friend behind hle baclr, or fnila to defend him from the
aiander cf othere, who aime only et being collad e wit, who inventa falaehood and
blebe eecrete, thet man ie a ecoundrc13 let every honeet citizen avoid him. 1 here
osten been nt tehlc when one cf the company hue umueed himeelf with braching hie
wit upon the gueate, not aparing the hort himaelf when he gete warm; now thie man
you look upon ua a funuy follow, while fer my innocent eetire I em called malignant, “
aurmatic, and eo forth. When your friend Petilllne ie mentioned yon defend him
after your own fachicn, that ie, yon damn him with a enocr, the werleet poison, which
ehall never ba found, if 1 know myeelf et all, in uny thing 1 moy write.

(v. 10³.) IfI have epolrenalittlatco freely of etherei may hepardoncd euthia gennem:
my excellent father alwaye taught mc ογ exemplos. If ha wbuld hura me lire fru-
gnlly, he would eay, “ Loolr et the mieery to which our friend hibiue’ eon und Burrue
have reduced themeclwee ογ their extravagance.” When he would keep me from bad
women, “Talae Scetuniua fur a wurniug.'’ “Seawbat ecandal ettochee to 'lh-ehcniue!¹
⁴‘ Wiacr men moy teach you ογ precept and theory: my carc ehall bc to wutch over
your pructice till yuuereable to tulre careof youreelf.” 1r he would hove me do
mmcching that wne right, ho would take unc of the judices and acy, “ 'lbere ie an
example scr you” On the ether hand, if he would prevent me from doing eumathing

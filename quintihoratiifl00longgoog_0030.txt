coast of Italy. eren this happened uobody kuows. After the publica·
tion ofthe three books of Odes, Horace seems ιο have censu frum that
style of writing, or nearly so; aud the only other compositione we know

of his having produced in the next few years are metrical Epistles to -

different friends, of which he published a volume probably in auo. 734
or 735. He seems to have taken up the stndy ofthe Greek philoso-
phical writers, aud ιο have got a good deal interested in them, andalao
ιο have become a little tired of the world aud disgusted with the
jsalousies his reputation created. His health did not improve as he got
older, aud he put himself under the care of Antonius Musa, the em-
peror’s new physieian⁸. By his advice he gave up, for a time at least,
his favonrite Baiae But he found it necessary ιο be a good deal away
from Rome, especially in the autumn and winter⁴.

In auc. 737 Augustus celebrated the Ludi Saeculares, and Horace
was required ιο write an Ode for the occasion, which he did, and ithae
been preserved. This circumstance, aud the credit it brought him, may
have given his mind another leaning ιο Ode-writing, aud have helped
him ιο produce the fourth book, a few piceos in which may have been
- written at any time. It is said that Augustus particularly deusd
llorace ιο publish another book of Odes, in order that those he wrote
upon the victories of Drusus and Tiberius (4 and 14) might appear in
it The latter of these Odes was not written, 1 believe, till auc. 741,
when Augustus returned from Gaul. If so, the book was probably
published in that year, when Horace was fifty-two. The Odes of the
fourth book show nc diminution of power, but the reverse. There are
none in the first three books that surpass or perhaps equnl the Ode
in honour of Drusus, and few superior to that which isaddusssed ιο
lollius. 'Ibe success of the first three books, and the honour of being
chosen ιο composa the Ode' at the Ludi Saeculares, seem ιο hare given
him encouragement. There are no incidente in his life during the above
period recorded οι· alluded to in his poems. He lived five years afler
the publication of the fourth book of Odes, if the above date be correct,
and during that time 1 think it probable be wrote the Epistles ιο Au·
gustus aud Florus which form the second book; and haring conceived
tlre intention of writing a poem on the art and progrcss of poetry, he
wrote as much of it as appears in the Epistle to the Pisones which hus
been preserved among hia works. The fingmento of which that poem
appears ιο be composed, and which some bave vainly tried tc reduco to
a oendstent whole, may have been written earlier than l have supposed3
bnt there is so much allinity between the Ars Poetioa and the Epistle
to Augustus that 1 believe they were written at no great interval of

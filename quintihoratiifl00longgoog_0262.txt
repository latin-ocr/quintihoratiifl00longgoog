of the Vindelici, end resohed to Lnle Come on the south. These tribes, whom the
historiens describe es very ιιι-ιι ιιι wsrlile, commeneed ι system οι predstory ineur-
sious into Cisalpine Gaul, in which they sppesr to beve prectieed the greatest etro·

brother οι liberius, was Quaestor st Rome, und in his twenty-third yeer. Ηι ιιι
required by Augustus to tclre the tield sgninst the offending tribes, whom he met under
the Tridentino Alpe ιιι ιιιιιιιι signslly. But though driven from Itely they con·
tinued their sttscks upon (lsul, ιιι Τιιιιιιι ιιι accordingly sent by Angustus with

brought to s conclusion in the montlr of August, on the anniversery ot the capture οι
Διιιιιιιιι by Angustus in ιιι year ’124 (C. ι. 87, Introduction). In honour οι these
victoriee llorsce composed this ode eud the fourteeuth ot this book, the one more er·
pressly to celebrate ιιι nume ot Drusus, the other οι liberine. ιιι ιιο odes therefore

EPISTLE Π.

Something has besn said about hd. Lollius, the consul, who was defeated by the
Signmhri, iu the Introduction to 0. ir. 9, which oda was sddresscd to him probably on
the occasion οι his defeat, some tima aster the writing of this Epistle to his oldest son,
as the person hers addressed is generally supposed to bc. The eightoeutb Iipistlsis
written to the sams person. There we learn that Lollius was with Angustus in the
Cantabrian expedition, ιιι. 729, ιιι that he hsd a brothor, ιο whom some suppose
the eighteenth Epistlo was written. It is plain that the person here addressed was
young, and if he bad been with the army, hs was now praetising for the Forum.
Horace addressss him ιι ‘paea' aud speaks of his deelaiming ιι ii he were still with
the rhetorical tsaohcr; but these tesohers attonded young men at horne siber thoy had
leit school and taught them the higher principles ol oratory. ‘Puer' isa word that
might be used familiarly towards ι young nran long past ‘pueritia’ and, as nanae
observes, it is not likely that those gravo riews of lile would bs sddrssssd to ι boy who
had not yet taken the ‘toga virilis! 1 think there is much probability in the dato
Franks supposes, mmo. 731, which would be a year albor Irollius' return from Spain
while he might yet bs quite young: though when Fraulre supporta his opinion by the
reference ia v. 53 to gout aad fomentatione, he only wealrens his argument (see note).
Why Lollius is eallsd Maximus in the first verse no one ιιι yet satisfactorily shown.
'I'hat he was the elder of two brothers, supposing that to have been the ease, would be
a ιιι reason ior calling him Maximus. lle would rather be called Major. But this is
the opinion of some editors, and οι Orelli among thern. 'l'hat he had the cognomen
Maximus is the explanation of others. [Krirgor affirma, on the authority of Gruter
638. 2, thot Maximus is ι cognomen ol ιιι (iens Lollia ς ιιι ιι compares ‘Maxime
Lolli' with‘Crispe Sallusti,’ 0. ii. 2. 3, ‘Hirpine Quinti,' 0. ii. 11. 2.] Βιι thereis
no troes of such a cognomen in this iamilyz the only cognomen they are irnown to
have borne during the republio isPslicsnus, ιιι ιιι father of this youth does not
appear to have had any. Young Lollius could not hare done any thing to gain himself
such a title3 ιιι οι the whole 1 am inclined to think the word is only a familiar half
jocular way ol addressing his young friend that Horace mss, ιι in the other Epistle
hs addresses him as ‘liberrime toni: Isse uo other way of explaining the word,
which Estrt gives up ιι unintelligible. [Ritter has discovered the secret. 'Pho Lollius
whom Horace addresses is M. Lollius, consul ιιι. 733, ιιι this Epistle was written
iu his consulship]

Horace has baeu mli-sshing himself with the oool broeras oi Praeneste, and rmding
Homer orer again, and has been more than ever impressed, ιι it would seem, with the
wisdom of his poema and tha moral and politica] lcssons thoy conwsy. Thisbe makes

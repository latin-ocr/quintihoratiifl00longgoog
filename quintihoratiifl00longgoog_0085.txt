HORATII FLACCI
CARMEN XIX.

Glyoera (Γλυκέρα) isone of Horsoa's mvourite namoe. Sheis set down ss the Cinara
of C. iv. 1³. 21 (see m), but with whst show ol reason, beyond their having the sama
number of syllables, itis not assy to see. We need not tuke Hortos teo much athis
word when he says that his dnys ol love were ovar. hiuny a young sentimeutnlist hus
imagined this und found himself mistaten as the poet appears to heve done. 'l'hoss
who choose to insist that Horaoe is‘sonfessing ou his own aeoount that “tho heydsy oi
his blood was tamed,'' put thie ode rather lata, huo. 72901 7³0. Others llud in the
allusion to the Parthian (v. 12) ocossion to hx the date a few years luter (734 or 735),
when the stendsrds of crassus had been reoovered from that troublesome enemy. 'lhis
important epoeh isever before the minds oi one section of the chronologiam: “dies
noctesque quidam veluti spectris territi cogitassent de signis et eaptivis a. 7³4 a Parthia
Augusto redditis,” says hinnke, whose senmeu, however, while it hu led him on the
whole intos more eonsistent aud probable chronologioal scheme than Kimhner and
others, is not ebove being misled by teo much seal for its own inventione. 1 should be
no more disposed with him to say Horace wrote this ode while the Arabian expedition
(ι. 29) was pendiug, than with his adversaries that he wrote it hveor six yearslnter.
Whenorunder whnt oimumstauoss or te whom (if any body) he wrote, we must be
eontent to be ignorum. (8oe C. iv. l, Introduction.)

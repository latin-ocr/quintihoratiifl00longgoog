Ῑι ιιιίιίιι ιι ιιο obloquy brought upon him by his mtiros, Horace, after his intimacy
witb Maecenas was known, had ιι meet ιιι envy auch good fortune was aure to excita.
His birth would firmiah a handle fur the enviom, and ιι wsa probably called un upstart
and hard names of that sort. In this satire, which is nothing but an epiatle to
Maecenas, ιι spuma ιιι idea of his birth being any objection ιο him, while at the
rame time he argues seusibly against men trying to get beyond their own legitimate
epham, and aiming at honours which are only attended with inconvenience, fatigue,
and ill will. This satire, besides tbe good ιιιιι ιιι good feeling it contains, isvuluahle
as bearing upon Horaoe’a life. Hie introduction to Maecenas is told mucisely, but
fully and with much propriety aud modest„ and nothing can be more pleasing than
aaa fllial affection and gratitudo shown in those parts that relate ιο ais father and tha
edumtim ιο gare him. He tales pleasure in referring whatever merite ιο might have
to this good parent, as he did in the fourth Satine.

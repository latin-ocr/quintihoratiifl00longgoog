Maecenas, why is it thst no man is content with his own lot, but every ons envies his
neighbour? 'lhs wssry soldier enuies the tradem the trader ou tho stormy deep
ouvius tho soldier-3 the jurisoonsult, impatient ol his oorly client, snvies the oountry·
man, who dmgged opto town bys lsw suit envies the inhabitants of tho town.
There is no ond to the instsnoes. Well, suppose some god were to offer them their
wish, und hid them ohango planes-thoy would refusa it! What hiuders ths wrath
of heaven from visiting these murmures-s, aad tho ears of Jove heiug closed against
thom forever? But to be serious (though truth may be told in just), thetoiliug
ploughman, tho chosting host, the soldier, the venturous trader, pretend their only
object is to securo a provisiou for old ogo, like tho unt provident of tho future. But
she retires when the winter oomss, and enjoys her store; whila wiotorsndsummor, dre,

Aufidus rather than from the little stream by your sido; but so you may dud that your

st Athous, whan the peoplo hissed him, said, ‘⁴ Never mind, l look ut my money·
